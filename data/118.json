            "explanationText": "<p>This patient with HIV had a week of progressive sore throat and then developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with tripod position, drooling, and hoarseness, raising strong suspicion for <strong>epiglottitis</strong>, a cellulitis of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and other adjacent tissue.&nbsp; Swelling of these structures often leads to rapid <strong>airway deterioration</strong>; therefore, <strong>airway management</strong> is the main priority.</p><p>In patients unable to maintain adequate oxygen saturations, <strong>bag-valve-mask ventilation</strong> (BVM) with 100% oxygen (to keep oxygen saturation &#8805;~88%) should be initiated.&nbsp; If BVM does not result in adequate oxygenation (ie, oxygen saturation remains low, as in this patient), <strong>endotracheal intubation using a video laryngoscope</strong> (to facilitate direct visualization of the epiglottis) should be attempted.</p><p>However, given the risk of rapid respiratory deterioration, failure of a single attempt at endotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope (as in this patient) should immediately prompt the establishment of a <strong>surgical cricothyrotomy</strong> by the most experienced provider available (preferably an otolaryngologist or general surgeon).&nbsp; Cricothyrotomy establishes an airway below the epiglottal swelling and potential obstruction.</p><p>Once the airway is stabilized, antimicrobial therapy is needed to clear the infection.&nbsp; This patient with untreated HIV has evidence of epiglottitis due to <em>Candida</em> (eg, white plaques on the oropharynx).&nbsp; In addition to antifungal therapy, he would also likely receive broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (eg, vancomycin, ceftriaxone) given the severity of the condition and the possibility of a secondary bacterial infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Laryngeal mask airway should not be used because it is a supraglottic airway device (above the obstruction).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Bilevel positive pressure is not able to overcome a significant epiglottal obstruction and is not recommended in patients who are hypoxic and fail an endotracheal airway.&nbsp; Surgical airway is required.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope are not recommended because this would delay adequate oxygenation in a patient who is severely hypoxic.&nbsp; A surgical airway should be established when a single attempt at video-assisted endotracheal intubation fails.&nbsp; If intubation <em>without</em> a video laryngoscope fails, intubation&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;a video laryngoscope could be attempted.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Blind nasotracheal intubation is not recommended because the swollen epiglottis must be visualized in order to effectively pass an endotracheal tube.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with epiglottitis who develop rapid-onset respiratory failure (eg, tripod position, hypoxia, drooling, tachypnea) require urgent airway management.&nbsp; This includes bag-valve-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen followed by endotracheal intubation with advanced equipment (eg, video laryngoscope).&nbsp; A single failed attempt at video-assisted endotracheal intubation should prompt surgical cricothyrotomy, which bypasses the epiglottal swelling and potential obstruction.</p>",

Surgery may be needed for moderate to severe cases with respiratory distress, cyanosis, or failure to thrive.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Compared with the trachea and supraglottic larynx, the subglottic airway is less flexible because it is supported by a complete ring of cartilage (the cricoid); as a result, there is minimal change in subglottic airway caliber in inspiration compared with expiration.&nbsp; Therefore, conditions that result in subglottic narrowing (eg, subglottic stenosis) often lead to biphasic stridor.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure due to diaphragm contraction (which lowers the diaphragm).&nbsp; In patients with a more collapsible intrathoracic airway (eg, <a href=\"23695\">tracheomalacia</a>), the decreased pressure widens the intrathoracic tracheal airway.&nbsp; In contrast, expiration increases <em>intrathoracic</em> pressure.&nbsp; In patients with tracheomalacia, the increased pressure <em>narrows</em> the intrathoracic tracheal airway, leading to <em>expiratory</em> stridor (rather than the <em>inspiratory</em> stridor seen with laryngomalacia).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Expiratory wheezing is a common symptom of asthma.&nbsp; Constriction of the smaller airways of the lungs lead to a whistling noise.&nbsp; Considering that these small airways are intrathoracic, the constriction is more pronounced during expiration because of increased intrathoracic pressure.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Rhonchi (low-pitched, rattling sounds that may occur on inspiration or expiration) are often caused by secretions in the bronchi and can be heard often in pneumonia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Laryngomalacia presents with inspiratory stridor due to dynamic collapse of the supraglottic tissues on inspiration.&nbsp; Stridor increases in periods of increased airflow (eg, crying, feeding).</p>",
