Vertigo can be due to an underlying disease in either the <strong>peripheral or central nervous system</strong>.&nbsp; In this patient, features concerning for a <strong>central cause of vertigo</strong> include:</p><ul><li><p>Pure <strong>vertical nystagmus</strong> (ie, down-beating) rarely occurs in peripheral vertigo because of the spatial orientation of the semicircular canals.&nbsp; In contrast, conjugate vertical gaze is coordinated in central neuronal tracts, so lesions here can lead to pure vertical nystagmus.</p></li><li><p>Nystagmus that has no latency period, is <strong>not fatigable</strong>, and is not inhibited by gaze fixation because it relates to a lesion that does not change with sensory input</p></li><li><p>Vertigo and nystagmus that <strong>do not change with head position</strong> (eg, <a href=\"48434\">Dix-Hallpike maneuver</a>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Postural instability</strong></p></li><li><p>Associated neurologic (eg, sensation or motor deficits) or constitutional (eg, weight loss, intense fatigue) symptoms</p></li></ul><p>Head imaging should be obtained in all patients with concern for a central cause of vertigo.&nbsp; CT scan is often obtained first because it can be completed faster than MRI, but an <strong>MRI is often needed</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; In this case, central vertigo in a young woman associated with intense fatigue related to heat intolerance is concerning for an initial presentation of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>.&nbsp; Head MRI would characteristically show periventricular white matter plaques.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease can cause vertigo.&nbsp; However, because it originates from an excess of endolymphatic fluid (ie, endolymphatic hydrops), nystagmus would have peripheral characteristics (eg, fatiguable, not purely vertical, inhibited with gaze fixation).&nbsp; In addition, it typically presents with intermittent (vs persistent) episodes of vertigo (20 min to hours) with aural fullness and hearing loss (which can be detected with an audiogram).&nbsp; In addition to lifestyle modifications, hydrochlorothiazide is often used as a first-line treatment to decrease the volume of endolymph.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Otolith repositioning maneuvers (eg, <a href=\"2025\">Epley</a>) are used to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).&nbsp; In contrast to this patient&#39;s condition, BPPV presents with intermittent, brief (&lt;1 min) episodes of vertigo provoked by head position changes.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Meclizine, an antihistamine, may be used as a temporary vestibular suppressant to improve symptoms from acute episodes of peripheral vertigo (eg, labyrinthitis, motion sickness).&nbsp; However, patients with signs of central vertigo require evaluation for stroke or other central causes (such as this patient&#39;s likely multiple sclerosis) rather than just symptomatic treatment.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Central vertigo often presents with nystagmus that is vertical, not fatigable, has no latency period, and does not change with head position.&nbsp; Postural instability is common, and patients often have other symptoms (eg, constitutional, other neurologic signs).&nbsp; Head imaging should be performed to evaluated for possible causes, including stroke or multiple sclerosis.</p>",

Most patients remain asymptomatic, but those with severe immunocompromise (eg, AIDS, solid-organ transplantation, immunosuppressant medications) can develop <strong>reactivation</strong> with CNS spread.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subacute manifestations</strong>:&nbsp; <em>Cryptococcus</em> produces capsular proteins that clog cerebrospinal fluid outflow, leading to <strong>slowly progressive</strong> symptoms (eg, headache, vomiting, confusion) of elevated intracranial pressure.</p></li><li><p>Characteristic lumbar puncture findings:&nbsp; Cryptococcal meningitis is marked by elevated opening pressure and cerebrospinal fluid evidence of <strong>lymphocytosis</strong>, <strong>mildly elevated</strong> white blood cell count, <strong>low glucose</strong>, and <strong>mildly elevated protein</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Diagnostic confirmation requires identification of the encapsulated yeast in cerebrospinal fluid (eg, India ink stain) or on polysaccharide antigen testing.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp;

Most cases of mononeuritis multiplex are triggered by underlying <strong>vasculitis</strong>, particularly <strong>polyarteritis nodosa</strong> (PAN).</p><p>PAN is marked by segmental transmural inflammation of medium-sized muscular arteries, which causes lumen narrowing, thrombosis, and subsequent organ ischemia.&nbsp; Arterial damage tends to be most severe in the following locations:</p><ul><li><p>Neurologic system:&nbsp; Mononeuritis multiplex develops in &gt;70% of patients with PAN due to damage to arteries supplying large peripheral nerves.&nbsp; Most cases are marked by <strong>asymmetric polyneuropathy</strong>, but progressive disease can lead to symmetric nerve involvement.</p></li><li><p>Skin:&nbsp; Several skin manifestations are linked to PAN, including <strong>livedo reticularis</strong> (reddish-blue, net-like pattern, as seen in this patient), erythematous nodules, and palpable purpura.</p></li><li><p>Renal system:&nbsp; Almost all patients with PAN have <strong>renal insufficiency</strong> due to renal artery narrowing, thrombosis, and infarctions.</p></li><li><p>Gastrointestinal system:&nbsp; Damage to mesenteric arteries can cause abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia, and bowel perforation.</p></li></ul><p>Patients with PAN tend to have very high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, which frequently causes <strong>constitutional symptoms</strong> (eg, malaise, intermittent fever, weight loss), <strong>elevated inflammatory markers</strong> (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and <strong>anemia of chronic disease</strong>.&nbsp; Because PAN is not typically associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) or high titers of antinuclear antibodies (seen with certain autoimmune conditions), the diagnosis generally requires tissue biopsy.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; AL amyloidosis is marked by the deposition of monoclonal light chains in tissue.&nbsp; Patients frequently have nephrotic syndrome, purpura (particularly in a raccoon pattern around the eyes), and compressive peripheral neuropathy (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome).&nbsp; Because amyloid is non-inflammatory, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and intermittent fever are unusual.&nbsp; In addition, livedo reticularis is uncommon.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Disseminated Lyme disease frequently causes radiculoneuritis and cranial neuropathy.&nbsp; However, the rash associated with Lyme disease is an annular lesion with central clearing that slowly spreads outward (erythema migrans); it is not livedo reticularis.&nbsp; In addition, abdominal pain and renal failure are uncommon.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Syphilis can cause systemic, dermatologic, and neurologic manifestations.&nbsp; However, cranial neuropathy or meningovascular neuropathy, rather than mononeuritis multiplex, are typical of neurosyphilis; and the classic rash of secondary syphilis is a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles.&nbsp; Renal failure is uncommon.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic sclerosis generally causes skin thickening/hardening and renal insufficiency.&nbsp; However, peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication, and livedo reticularis is atypical.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Polyarteritis nodosa often causes mononeuritis multiplex, a neuropathy of &#8805;2 noncontiguous peripheral nerves.&nbsp;
