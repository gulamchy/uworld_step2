Proteinuria in HIVAN results from direct viral infection of glomerular <a href=\"12155\">podocytes</a>, which causes widespread foot process effacement.&nbsp; In addition, HIV-infected podocytes undergo a process of proliferation and scarring, resulting in a severe variant of <strong>focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</strong> (FSGS) with collapsing glomeruli.</p><p>This collapsing FSGS typically causes <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> and often results in <strong>rapidly progressive renal failure</strong>.&nbsp; Patients <strong>with advanced HIV</strong> (low CD4 count, high viral load) are more susceptible, although HIVAN may also occur with less advanced disease.&nbsp; <strong>Antiretroviral therapy</strong> should be initiated or continued in patients with HIVAN to slow the progression of renal failure.&nbsp; Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (eg, ACE inhibitors) reduce proteinuria and help delay kidney dysfunction.&nbsp; Many patients develop end-stage renal disease even with optimal therapy.</p><p>Because HIV can injure the kidneys by a variety of mechanisms (eg, immune-complex kidney disease), a kidney biopsy should be performed in suspected HIVAN.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Certain medications that are poorly soluble in urine (eg, protease inhibitors, sulfamethoxazole-containing antibiotics) can cause crystal-induced tubular dysfunction.&nbsp; Although AKI is typical, urinalysis typically shows urine crystals (crystalluria), hematuria, and pyuria, rather than nephrotic syndrome.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Although drug-induced interstitial nephritis can occur with antibiotics (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and antiretrovirals (eg, protease inhibitors), urinalysis reflects the immunologic reaction to offending drugs by showing pyuria (often with white blood cell casts); nephrotic-range proteinuria is atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pigment nephropathy is characterized by renal tubular deposition of heme pigments released by degraded myoglobin (rhabdomyolysis) or free hemoglobin (hemolysis).&nbsp; Urinalysis is dipstick positive for blood (detects heme) without microscopic evidence of intact red blood cells.&nbsp; Nephrotic-range proteinuria and resulting lipiduria (oval fat bodies), as seen in this patient, would not be expected in pigment nephropathy.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Postinfectious glomerulonephritis typically causes <a href=\"19104\">nephritic syndrome</a>, rather than nephrotic syndrome, in association with streptococcal, rather than <em>Pneumocystis</em>, infection.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is caused by viral infection of podocytes that leads to nephrotic syndrome and a severe variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with collapsing glomeruli.&nbsp; Suspected HIVAN requires confirmation of collapsing FSGS by biopsy because HIV can injure the kidneys by a variety of mechanisms.&nbsp; Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated or continued in patients with HIVAN to slow the progression of renal failure.</p>",

One of the most common causes in adults is <strong>lithium</strong>, which accumulates in <strong>renal collecting ducts</strong> and blocks responsiveness to ADH.&nbsp; After water deprivation (eg, overnight fasting), serum osmolality rises (eg, &gt;295 mOsmol/kg, often with hypernatremia) and ADH increases appropriately;

Psychogenic polydipsia is classically associated with psychiatric conditions or disorders affecting thirst.&nbsp; Polyuria and dilute urine are seen; however, in contrast to DI, they represent appropriate responses to excessive water intake, and both ADH sensitivity and production are intact.&nbsp; Therefore, following water deprivation, ADH rises and urine becomes concentrated (ie, urine osmolality increases &gt;300 mOsmol/kg).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s dilute urine following water deprivation makes psychogenic polydipsia unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Pancreatic cell destruction causes type 1 diabetes mellitus; severe hyperglycemia (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis) can precipitate glucosuria and associated osmotic diuresis.&nbsp; However, osmotic diuresis is associated with high, rather than low, urine osmolality, and this patient&#39;s fasting blood sugar is only mildly elevated.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"2663\">Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors</a> are diabetic medications that act on the proximal tubule of the kidney, leading to increased excretion of glucose and associated osmotic diuresis.&nbsp; This patient has no history of SGLT-2 inhibitor use, and her low urine osmolality makes osmotic diuresis unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; This patient&#39;s elevated TSH suggests suboptimally treated hypothyroidism (possibly from chronic lithium therapy).&nbsp; However, hypothyroidism is not associated with nocturia or persistently dilute urine.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chronic lithium therapy is commonly associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI), presenting with polyuria and persistently dilute urine.&nbsp; Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI results from lithium accumulation in the renal collecting ducts, which leads to antidiuretic hormone resistance and impaired renal water reabsorption.</p>",

Such a multisystem involvement is suggestive of <strong>small-vessel vasculitis</strong> (SVV), which can target the arterioles, capillaries, and venules of virtually any organ (eg, skin, kidney, nerve).&nbsp; Identification of the <strong>underlying cause</strong> of SVV requires a broad diagnostic strategy:</p><ul><li>Recognize vasculitic pattern</li><li>Obtain serologies (eg, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA], complement)</li><li>&plusmn; Biopsy affected organ</li><li>Evaluate secondary causes (eg, viral studies, autoimmune testing, medication review)</li></ul><p>This patient&#39;s <strong>hepatitis C</strong> virus (HCV) antibodies and hepatomegaly suggest secondary SVV due to <strong>mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome</strong> (MCS; cryoglobulinemic vasculitis).&nbsp; Chronic HCV infection is the most common cause of MCS.&nbsp; The exact pathogenesis is unclear, but HCV infection may be associated with B-cell activation that leads to selective production of cryoglobulins (immunoglobulins that precipitate at &lt;37 C).&nbsp; In MCS, the cryoglobulins are a mixture of polyclonal IgGs and IgMs with <strong>rheumatoid factor</strong> (RF) activity (bind to Fc portion of IgG); cryoglobulin-containing <strong>immune complexes</strong> activate complement, causing <strong>hypocomplementemia</strong>, and deposit in small vessels, causing SVV.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Like most SVV, IgA vasculitis can cause palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, and arthralgias.&nbsp; However, it commonly has associated gastrointestinal symptoms and is relatively rare in adults.&nbsp; IgA nephropathy denotes renal-limited IgA vasculitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is one of 3 small-vessel vasculitides mediated by ANCA rather than immune complexes; therefore, complements are normal.&nbsp; Although MPA commonly causes glomerulonephritis, palpable purpura, and neuropathy, ANCA is typically positive and pulmonary involvement is common.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Rheumatoid arthritis usually produces RFs but only rarely causes SVV.&nbsp; Rheumatoid vasculitis can cause palpable purpura.&nbsp; However, skin findings classically involve leg ulcers, vasculitis typically occurs in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, and small joint synovitis/deformity would be expected.&nbsp; Glomerulonephritis is atypical, and HCV is not associated.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can closely mimic SVV (eg, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, arthralgia) and, in rare cases, cause SVV due to MCS.&nbsp; Hypocomplementemia is common with active disease, and RF is not unusual (even in the absence of MCS).&nbsp; However, SLE usually affects young women and is unlikely in this patient without the typical symptoms (eg, malar rash, oral ulcers).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is a small-vessel vasculitis that commonly presents with palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgias.&nbsp; Chronic hepatitis C infection is the most common cause, and characteristic laboratory abnormalities include hepatitis C antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and hypocomplementemia.</p>",

In an otherwise asymptomatic child, enuresis is typically genetic (most have &#8805;1 parents affected during childhood) and developmental, with self-resolution expected as bladder control matures.&nbsp; However, an underlying medical condition should be suspected when other signs or symptoms are present, as in this case.</p><p>In addition to wetting the bed, this child is irritable and inattentive with <strong>tonsillar hypertrophy</strong>.&nbsp; These findings are concerning for <strong>obstructive sleep apnea</strong> (OSA) as the underlying cause of his enuresis.&nbsp; Enuresis may reflect apnea effects on arousal response (eg, effects on bladder pressure, urinary hormone secretion) or difficulties awakening in response to a full bladder.&nbsp; Instead of daytime somnolence seen in adults with OSA, <strong>behavioral concerns</strong> (eg, inattention, impulsivity) and <strong>mood changes</strong> (eg, emotional lability) are common manifestations of sleep disturbance in children.&nbsp; OSA is also associated with increased blood pressure (as seen here); chronic symptoms can result in poor growth (decreased nocturnal growth hormone secretion) and cardiovascular complications (eg, cor pulmonale).</p><p>Evaluation of OSA is with <strong>nocturnal polysomnography</strong> (ie, sleep study), which detects and quantifies respiratory pauses and desaturations during sleep.&nbsp; Treatment of OSA (eg, adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure) can lead to resolution of associated enuresis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; A trial of methylphenidate may be indicated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can also present with irritability and inattention and has association with enuresis.&nbsp; However, ADHD would not explain this child&#39;s tonsillar hypertrophy.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Urodynamic testing can be considered in a patient with findings concerning for bladder dysfunction, such as daytime incontinence, weak stream, dribbling, straining, or urgency, none of which is present in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be considered for nocturnal enuresis that is not due to an underlying medical problem and is refractory to first-line management (eg, desmopressin, bed-wetting alarm).&nbsp; Evaluation and management of coexisting conditions, such as OSA, should be prioritized before initiating pharmacotherapy for enuresis.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Reassurance and follow-up are appropriate for normal bed-wetting behaviors in an otherwise asymptomatic child age &lt;5.&nbsp; This patient with behavioral concerns,&nbsp;enlarged tonsils, and hypertension requires further workup for his enuresis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Nocturnal enuresis secondary to obstructive sleep apnea should be considered in a child who has bed-wetting in addition to inattention, behavioral concerns, hypertension, and/or tonsillar hypertrophy.&nbsp; Evaluation is with nocturnal polysomnography.</p>",
