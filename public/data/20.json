The leaked gastrointestinal contents cause severe <strong>chest/abdominal pain</strong> and a systemic inflammatory response (eg, <strong>fever</strong>, tachycardia) that can quickly progress to septic shock and death; the leaked air <strong>(pneumomediastinum)</strong> may be palpated as <strong>suprasternal crepitus</strong> (subcutaneous emphysema).</p><p>These features distinguish esophageal perforation from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, which can be due to a similar etiology (eg, retching) but leads only to a partial-thickness tear classically associated with hematemesis (from submucosal plexus bleeding) <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.</p><p>Visualization of contrast extravasating from the esophagus into surrounding tissues, either by esophagography or CT scan with water-soluble contrast (barium is more inflammatory), confirms the diagnosis of esophageal perforation.&nbsp; Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors should be administered, all oral intake restricted, and <strong>emergent surgical consultation</strong> obtained.&nbsp; Most perforations will require operative debridement and repair.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; This patient&#39;s upper abdominal pain in the setting of heavy alcohol consumption is concerning for acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; However, acute pancreatitis does not cause suprasternal crepitus and&mdash;except in severe cases (eg, multiorgan failure)&mdash;is not typically associated with fever.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Aortic dissection should always be considered with acute-onset, severe chest pain, especially if risk factors are present (eg, Marfan syndrome in a tall, thin patient).&nbsp; However, crepitus and fever in the setting of protracted vomiting make esophageal perforation much more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Aspiration of inflammatory gastric acid can occur with protracted vomiting, potentially inciting pneumonitis.&nbsp; This can cause chest pain and fever but would typically present as abrupt-onset respiratory distress with diffuse lung field crackles (due to inflammatory edema) on auscultation.&nbsp; It would not cause crepitus.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Primary spontaneous pneumothorax can occur in tall, thin young men from rupture of a subpleural bleb.&nbsp; Pneumothorax might cause dyspnea and subcutaneous emphysema, but decreased breath sounds would be expected on the affected side.&nbsp; Fever is uncommon.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Effort rupture of the esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) can occur with vomiting.&nbsp; Leakage of esophageal air through the full-thickness perforation may cause pneumomediastinum, evidenced by suprasternal crepitus on examination.&nbsp; Confirmation with esophagography or CT scan using water-soluble contrast should prompt emergent surgical consultation.</p>",
