Because sedatives and general anesthesia impair the cough reflex and glottal function, exposure to these medications increases the risk of aspirating oropharyngeal or gastric contents.&nbsp; Aspiration of gastric contents (eg, <strong>during emesis</strong>) can lead to 2 distinct clinical syndromes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chemical pneumonitis:</strong>&nbsp; Aspiration of gastric acid causes erosive damage to the bronchial and alveolar epithelium, leading to symptoms within a <strong>few minutes or hours</strong> of exposure.&nbsp; Manifestations typically include dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia, and low-grade fever.&nbsp; Chest x-ray usually reveals an infiltrate in a dependent portion of the lung (eg, <strong>posterior segment of the upper lobes</strong>).&nbsp; Most cases of chemical pneumonitis <strong>resolve spontaneously</strong> within 36 hours with supportive treatment; no antibiotics are generally required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bacterial aspiration pneumonia:</strong>&nbsp; Aspiration of large quantities of microorganisms from the stomach or oropharynx can overwhelm host defense mechanisms, leading to pneumonia <strong>several days</strong> after the event.&nbsp; Manifestations typically include progressive fever, cough productive of putrid sputum, and an infiltrate in a dependent portion of the lung.&nbsp; Because recent data shows aspiration pneumonia is primarily due to upper airway aerobic bacteria (rather than anaerobes), first-line treatment targets community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (eg, amoxicillin plus azithromycin); in contrast, patients with aspiration pneumonia who also have empyema or lung abscess should be treated with agents that cover anaerobes (eg, ampicillin-sulbactam).</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Most cases of chemical pneumonitis do not lead to bacterial pneumonia.&nbsp; Therefore, antibiotics are generally withheld unless respiratory status deteriorates 24-72 hours after the event.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchiectasis is marked by a long-standing cough with mucopurulent sputum.&nbsp; It is often seen after foreign body inhalation (eg, chicken bone, peanut), not chemical pneumonitis.&nbsp; Other common causes of bronchiectasis include cigarette smoking, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised states, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with long-standing, recurrent aspiration of gastric acid (eg, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease) are at increased risk for pulmonary fibrosis.&nbsp; However, a single aspiration event is unlikely to significantly increase pulmonary fibrosis risk.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with severe smoke inhalation injury or those who have been intubated &gt;7 days are at increased risk for tracheal stenosis.&nbsp; A single aspiration event is unlikely to cause this condition.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Sedatives and general anesthesia increase the risk for aspiration.&nbsp; Aspiration of gastric contents can lead to either chemical pneumonitis or bacterial pneumonia.&nbsp; Symptoms of chemical pneumonitis (eg, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia) typically occur within a few minutes/hours of aspiration and resolve spontaneously within 36 hours.&nbsp; In contrast, symptoms of bacterial pneumonia (eg, fever, cough with putrid sputum) arise after several days and require antibiotics for resolution.</p>",

However, other <strong>medical conditions</strong> (eg, seizures, hearing impairment) can have symptoms that <strong>mimic ADHD</strong>.&nbsp; An alternate diagnosis should be considered when certain historical clues are present, particularly in a patient with sudden or late onset (eg, adolescence) of symptoms <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.&nbsp; In this case, the patient&#39;s elevated BMI, snoring, and daytime sleepiness raise concern for <strong>obstructive sleep apnea</strong> (OSA).</p><p>OSA is characterized by intermittent airway obstruction, resulting in fragmented sleep.&nbsp; Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is often the cause in young children, but <strong>obesity</strong> is a common risk factor in adolescents.&nbsp; Frequent <strong>snoring</strong> is typical, and insufficient sleep often leads to <strong>napping at unexpected times</strong> (eg, during school).&nbsp; In some children, presentation may be limited to <strong>behavioral problems</strong> and symptoms overlapping with ADHD because excessive sleepiness can cause patients to be irritable (eg, fighting with sister), easily frustrated (eg, throwing homework), and impulsive.</p><p>Findings concerning for OSA warrant evaluation with a <strong>sleep study</strong> before a diagnosis of ADHD can be made because treatment with positive airway pressure typically results in improvement of behavioral problems in those with confirmed OSA.&nbsp; Presuming a diagnosis of ADHD without evaluation for OSA may expose patients to unnecessary pharmacotherapy (eg, methylphenidate) and its potential side effects <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Childhood depression may cause irritability and can be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, escitalopram).&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s snoring and elevated BMI make OSA a more likely cause of his behavioral symptoms.&nbsp; Moreover, a confidential interview and standardized depression screening questionnaire are typically performed before prescribing medication for depression.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Family therapy may help address sibling fighting and changing family dynamics (eg, new child), while parent management training can help caregivers extinguish problematic behaviors (eg, interrupting).&nbsp; However, evaluation for OSA takes precedence in this patient because symptoms would likely continue despite these interventions if OSA is present and remains untreated.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can present in children with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and should be considered when other key findings are present, including obesity, snoring, and daytime sleepiness.&nbsp; Evaluation with a sleep study is required before a diagnosis of ADHD can be made because treatment of OSA (eg, positive airway pressure) can lead to resolution of behavioral symptoms.</p>",

Most parapneumonic effusions are uncomplicated, resulting from increased flow of sterile exudate into the intrapleural space.&nbsp; These effusions typically resolve with antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and require no additional treatment.&nbsp; <strong>Complicated parapneumonic effusion</strong> (and empyemas, which represent the advanced stage of complicated parapneumonic effusions) must be recognized because they involve <strong>bacterial invasion into the pleural space</strong>.&nbsp; In addition to antibiotics, drainage of the effusion via chest tube is typically required.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s <strong>positive pleural fluid Gram stain</strong> showing gram-positive cocci in pairs (consistent with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) is <strong>diagnostic</strong> of a complicated effusion, and <strong>chest tube placement</strong> is indicated.</p><p>Oftentimes, pleural fluid bacterial counts are low in a complicated effusion, and Gram stain and bacterial culture are falsely negative.&nbsp; In such cases, additional pleural fluid studies can confirm a complicated effusion.&nbsp; Because bacteria in the pleural space metabolize glucose and generate acidic waste, <strong>low pleural fluid glucose</strong> levels (eg, &lt;60 mg/dL) or <strong>pH &lt;7.2</strong> is diagnostic of a complicated effusion and is an indication for drainage.&nbsp; Significantly <strong>elevated leukocytes</strong> (eg, &gt;50,000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>) and <strong>lactate dehydrogenase levels &gt;1,000 U/L</strong> also suggest bacterial invasion of the pleural space and may be indications for drainage.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchoscopy can be helpful in the diagnosis of pneumonia with an atypical presentation (eg, chronic symptoms, unresponsive to antibiotics), but it is not indicated in this patient with a typical presentation of community-acquired pneumonia.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Chest physiotherapy may help dislodge pulmonary mucus and is used in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it has not shown benefit in the management of acute pneumonia.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Serial chest x-rays (to ensure resolution of the effusion) without additional therapy are appropriate for an uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic corticosteroid therapy is used for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but it does not have a role in the management of parapneumonic effusions.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is sometimes needed to debride and remove loculated and fibrotic fluid collections that develop with an advanced complicated effusion (ie, empyema).&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s complicated effusion is free flowing and amenable to chest tube drainage.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Complicated parapneumonic effusions involve bacterial invasion into the pleural space and require drainage in addition to antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Positive pleural fluid Gram stain or culture is diagnostic of a complicated effusion and is an indication for chest tube placement.</p>",

The presentation is highly suggestive of <strong>bronchiectasis</strong>, a disorder characterized by vicious cycles of infection and inflammation resulting in airway dilation.&nbsp; Mucostasis promotes bacterial overgrowth, perpetuating the cycle of infection and inflammation.</p><p>Chronic airway wall inflammation leads to submucosal erosion, producing <strong>bronchial arteriolar bleeding</strong> that ranges from chronic minimal streaking to acute life-threatening frank hemoptysis.&nbsp; Worsening hemoptysis may indicate an exacerbation of bronchiectasis.&nbsp; In most instances, treatment of superinfection (eg, antibiotics) and mucus retention (eg, airway clearance, mucolytics) resolves the hemoptysis.&nbsp; However, bronchoscopy or bronchial artery embolization is occasionally necessary for severe cases.</p><p>In this patient, bronchiectasis should be confirmed with a high-resolution CT scan, and underlying causes (eg, immunodeficiency/hypogammaglobulinemia) should be sought.&nbsp; Respiratory cultures are indicated to assess for superimposed infection as the trigger for worsening hemoptysis and to tailor antimicrobial therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Chronic bronchitis also causes daily mucus production.&nbsp; However, it mainly affects individuals with a significant smoking history and generates less sputum volume relative to bronchiectasis.&nbsp; Scant hemoptysis can occur during acute flares (typically viral or sterile exacerbation) but is otherwise uncommon.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s history of recurrent infection (typically bacterial exacerbation), copious sputum production, and hemoptysis is therefore more consistent with bronchiectasis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Interstitial lung disease (ILD) can cause chronic cough, but it is typically dry/nonproductive and free of hemoptysis due to lack of primary airway pathology.&nbsp; Bronchiectasis can accompany ILD but is usually the result of lung architecture distortion (traction bronchiectasis) rather than recurrent infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Mitral stenosis causes hemoptysis via pulmonary congestion, resulting in edema and capillary rupture.&nbsp; However, cardiac examination would reveal a diastolic murmur; signs of right heart failure would be present; and the sputum would likely be pink and frothy rather than frankly bloody.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; In rare instances, bleeding disorders (eg, severe thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy) can present with hemoptysis.&nbsp; However, the most common initial presentation is mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, petechiae, purpura).&nbsp; Furthermore, hemostatic abnormalities would not explain the daily copious mucoid sputum production.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Tuberculosis can produce chronic cough and hemoptysis but not thick, daily sputum.&nbsp; Patients usually have associated symptoms of low-grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Bronchiectasis is an important cause of hemoptysis in adults.&nbsp; It results from airway infection/inflammation and erosion in submucosal bronchial arterioles.&nbsp; Bleeding ranges from chronic blood-streaked sputum to acute life-threatening frank hemoptysis.</p>",

and recurrent pulmonary infections.&nbsp; This presentation is highly suggestive of <strong>bronchiectasis</strong>, a condition characterized by <a href=\"5177\">recurrent cycles</a> of infection (mostly bacterial) and inflammation (mainly neutrophilic) leading to bronchial wall damage and <strong>permanent airway dilation</strong>.</p><p>Dilated airways congest with mucus, leading to bacterial overgrowth.&nbsp; This sets the stage for repeated <strong>exacerbations</strong> (eg, this patient&#39;s 7 antibiotic-responsive episodes of foul mucopurulent sputum).&nbsp; Due to the intense suppurative inflammation, constitutional symptoms (eg, malaise) are common during exacerbations.&nbsp; Erosion into submucosal bronchial arterioles produces <strong>hemoptysis</strong>, which can be life threatening.</p><p><a href=\"48693\">Chest x-ray</a> is not diagnostic for bronchiectasis but can reveal suggestive findings, such as dilated and thickened airways (prominent bronchial markings, ring shadows when viewed head on).&nbsp; <strong>High-resolution CT (HRCT)</strong> scanning of the chest is required to diagnose bronchiectasis because it <a href=\"57414\">clearly visualizes</a> the bronchial wall thickening <strong>(tram tracking)</strong>, lack of distal airway tapering, and bronchial dilation (bronchial diameter larger than adjacent pulmonary artery, a finding referred to as the &#x22;signet ring&#x22; sign).</p><p>Once the diagnosis is established with HRCT, the underlying cause of bronchiectasis should be identified and treated if possible.&nbsp; Possible causes include chronic mycobacterial infection, immunodeficiency (eg, hypogammaglobulinemia), and autoimmune disease (eg, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchoscopy is recommended to evaluate <a href=\"57415\">focal bronchiectasis</a>, especially to exclude an upstream obstructing lesion.&nbsp; Diffuse bronchiectasis, which this patient has, usually reflects a systemic condition (eg, immunodeficiency).&nbsp; Alveolar lavage is not diagnostically informative because the disease involves the conducting airways rather than the alveolar sacs.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; In bronchiectasis, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show an obstructive pattern (ie, reduced FEV1/FVC ratio) due to airway floppiness and mucus plugging (even though the airways are dilated).&nbsp; However, spirometric obstruction is nonspecific&nbsp;and cannot differentiate between bronchiectasis and other obstructive lung diseases (eg, chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis).&nbsp; Once the diagnosis of bronchiectasis is established with imaging, regular PFTs are indicated to monitor lung function.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Mycobacterial infection (especially <em>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</em> complex) is a common cause of non&ndash;cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.&nbsp; Sputum acid-fast bacilli analysis should be performed in patients with bronchiectasis, but the diagnosis should first be confirmed with HRCT.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Echocardiography evaluates for left ventricular heart failure, which can produce chronic wet cough and prominent bronchovascular markings (due to airway edema).&nbsp; However, the sputum is typically frothy/thin, and heart failure is unlikely without orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or evidence of volume overload.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Bronchiectasis causes permanent bronchial dilation due to recurrent cycles of infection and inflammation.&nbsp; Hallmark symptoms include chronic copious, thick sputum production; episodic hemoptysis; and recurrent exacerbations with mucopurulent sputum.&nbsp; Bronchiectasis is diagnosed based on high-resolution CT scan of the chest.</p>",
