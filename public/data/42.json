<strong>Premature infants</strong>, particularly those with <strong>respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (RDS), are at particularly increased risk because insufficient surfactant makes the alveoli less expandable and more prone to rupture.&nbsp; <strong>Mechanical ventilation</strong> (eg, nasal continuous positive airway pressure [nCPAP] in a neonate) also increases pneumothorax risk by increasing transpulmonary pressure.&nbsp; In addition, meconium aspiration syndrome (most common in postmature neonates) is associated with pneumothorax because meconium plugging of airways traps distal gas, promoting alveolar overdistension and rupture.</p><p>Typical presentation includes acute-onset <strong>tachypnea</strong>, grunting, cyanosis, and <strong>decreased breath sounds</strong> on the affected side.&nbsp; Patients with a <strong>tension pneumothorax</strong>, in which high intrapleural pressure decreases venous return and subsequent cardiac output, exhibit severe distress with hypotension and hypoxemia.&nbsp; Accumulation of intrapleural air may cause displacement of the heart to the right, as in this case.</p><p>Increased brightness over the affected hemithorax on <strong>transillumination</strong> of the chest is supportive of the diagnosis.&nbsp; Chest radiograph may be performed in hemodynamically stable patients or if the diagnosis remains unclear after transillumination <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.&nbsp; This patient with hypoxia, severe respiratory distress, mediastinal deviation, and unilateral positive transillumination likely has a life-threatening tension pneumothorax, and <strong>emergency needle thoracostomy</strong> is required to evacuate the intrapleural air.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although positive airway pressure is associated with increased risk of pneumothorax, this premature infant has surfactant deficiency and requires respiratory support.&nbsp; Therefore, reducing mean airway pressure should be considered, but discontinuing nCPAP&nbsp;altogether will worsen atelectasis and distress.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s pneumothorax is causing hemodynamic instability and must be evacuated first.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) prevents collapse of alveoli upon expiration and can contribute to alveolar distension.&nbsp; Increasing PEEP in a patient with tension pneumothorax would likely increase intrapleural air and should be avoided.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Chest physiotherapy can be helpful in treating atelectasis due to RDS or meconium plugging.&nbsp; In contrast to pneumothorax, atelectasis does not transilluminate.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Echocardiogram is used to evaluate for congenital heart disease, which can present with hypoxia and respiratory distress.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s unilaterally decreased breath sounds, lack of murmur, and transillumination findings make pneumothorax more likely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>The risk of pneumothorax is increased in premature neonates, particularly those with respiratory distress syndrome who are receiving mechanical ventilation.&nbsp; Transillumination reveals increased brightness on the affected side.&nbsp; Hemodynamic instability or signs of tension pneumothorax (eg, mediastinal shift) warrant emergency needle thoracostomy.</p>",

The hallmark of ARDS is neutrophilic lung inflammation with <strong>increased vascular permeability</strong>, leading to pulmonary edema in the absence of cardiac failure or volume overload.&nbsp; However, once ARDS is established, excessive intravascular volume serves only to <strong>exacerbate fluid escape</strong>, leading to worsened pulmonary edema and delayed recovery.</p><p><strong>Fluid balance</strong> refers to the net sum of all fluid intake and output from the time of admission.&nbsp; Patients with ARDS often have an initial positive fluid balance (eg, volume resuscitation for sepsis, blood transfusion for trauma).&nbsp; During hospitalization, a <strong>conservative fluid strategy</strong> aimed at achieving a <strong>neutral or negative</strong> fluid balance accelerates recovery from ARDS, with a trend toward improved survival rate (&#x22;dry lungs = happy lungs&#x22;).</p><p>This goal is accomplished by:</p><ul><li>Minimizing intake:&nbsp; avoiding unnecessary fluid boluses, concentrating intravenous drips</li><li>Promoting removal:&nbsp; diuretics, renal replacement therapy</li></ul><p>Patients with refractory hypotension (eg, septic shock) should be assessed for fluid-responsiveness prior to blind volume loading (eg, via passive leg raise to simulate a fluid bolus).&nbsp; Vasopressors (eg, norepinephrine) may be required to support hemodynamics to permit volume removal.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Lung inflation is determined by the set tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which can be set on the mechanical ventilator.&nbsp; Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) (&#8804;6 mL/kg) protects the lungs by limiting alveolar overdistension to mitigate further injury.&nbsp; LTVV often causes mild hypercapnic respiratory acidosis, as seen in this patient.&nbsp; This &#x22;permissive&#x22; hypercapnia is well-tolerated and correlated with improved survival.&nbsp; PEEP opens the lung by propping open collapsed alveoli (decreasing atelectasis); however, this must be balanced with the risk of overinflating alveoli that are already open.&nbsp; Therefore, tidal volume and PEEP must be carefully selected to <strong>optimize</strong> (rather than maximize) lung inflation while avoiding overdistension.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The ideal oxygen saturation range in ARDS, validated through clinical trials, is 92%-96%, corresponding to PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> of 60-90 mm Hg.&nbsp; This avoids overt hypoxemia or hyperoxia (oxidative stress can aggravate lung injury).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Deep sedation may be required to promote patient-ventilator synchrony (ie, matching patient respiratory efforts to the mechanical ventilator breaths), which decreases oxygen consumption and self-inflicted barotrauma.&nbsp; However, excessive sedation increases the risk of delirium, deconditioning, and prolonged intubation.&nbsp; Sedation should be routinely tapered off (ie, daily sedation holiday) as soon as feasible to promote wakefulness and eventual extubation.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>A negative fluid balance decreases the formation of pulmonary edema and accelerates recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p>",

This presentation is most consistent with <strong>acute respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (ARDS) due to <strong>sepsis</strong>.</p><p>ARDS develops in the setting of direct (eg, pneumonia, aspiration) or indirect (eg, sepsis, pancreatitis) lung injury.&nbsp; Sepsis is a dysregulated host inflammatory response to infection (eg, endometritis), which promotes <strong>increased alveolar capillary permeability</strong>, exudation of proteinaceous fluid into the airspaces, and recruitment of leukocytes and cytokines into the lung.&nbsp; <strong>Gas exchange is impaired</strong> due to severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch owing to intrapulmonary shunt effect (perfusion of flooded, gasless alveoli).&nbsp; <strong>Lung compliance is reduced</strong> due to pulmonary edema and loss of surfactant.&nbsp; <a href=\"4590\">Bilateral infiltrates</a> (noncardiogenic diffuse pulmonary edema) are seen on chest imaging.&nbsp; Mechanical ventilation is often required to support patients with severe respiratory failure.&nbsp; Increased FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is required to maintain an adequate PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (<strong>PaO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font><strong>/FiO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font>&nbsp;<strong>&#8804;300</strong> is a diagnostic requirement for ARDS).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can cause respiratory distress and diffuse bilateral infiltrates (blood within the alveoli).&nbsp; It is usually associated with specific drugs (eg, crack cocaine) or rheumatologic conditions (eg, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody vasculitides) and is an unlikely complication of sepsis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hospital-acquired pneumonia presents with fever and purulent cough (bacterial infection).&nbsp; Although it may sometimes progress to ARDS, the pneumonia is usually lobar/focal, rather than diffuse, in onset and does not cause rapidly progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Iatrogenic volume overload is rare in the absence of cardiac dysfunction.&nbsp; Postpartum cardiomyopathy can occur from the last month of gestation to 5 months after delivery; however, it is unlikely in this patient with no jugular venous distension, S3, or cardiomegaly on chest x-ray.&nbsp; Her mild edema of the lower extremities is likely due to pregnancy.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary thromboembolism can cause respiratory distress, but chest x-ray is typically clear (no alveolar opacities).&nbsp; Wedge-shaped areas of infarction (Hampton hump) or peripheral lucency (Westermark sign) due to reduced blood flow may be present occasionally.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Findings of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include respiratory distress, severe hypoxemia, and bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging, which are not explained by volume overload.&nbsp; Sepsis is a pathologic host inflammatory response to infection and a leading etiology of ARDS.</p>",

Loss of <a href=\"17983\">intravascular volume</a> leads to a decrease in venous return to the right atrium (<strong>decreased preload</strong>) and a consequent <strong>decrease in cardiac output</strong> and systemic blood pressure.&nbsp; In an effort to maintain adequate cardiac output and organ perfusion, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction (<strong>increase in systemic vascular resistance</strong>) and an increase in heart rate.&nbsp; The left ventricle, decreased in size due to low filling volume, also compensates by <strong>increasing ejection fraction</strong>.</p><p>These responses create the typical clinical presentation of hypovolemic shock, which includes hypotension, tachycardia, <strong>cold extremities</strong>, evidence of poor organ perfusion (eg, somnolence, unresponsiveness), and physical examination evidence of hypovolemia (eg, <strong>flat neck veins</strong>).&nbsp; Despite the compensatory mechanisms in hypovolemic shock, cardiac output cannot be sustained and circulatory collapse (and death) occurs in the absence of aggressive volume resuscitation and control of volume loss.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Diastolic collapse (failure of ventricular filling) due to elevated right ventricular filling pressure is characteristic of cardiac tamponade.&nbsp; This scenario can occur in the setting of blunt thoracic trauma (eg, hemopericardium); however, jugular venous distension and distant heart sounds should be present.&nbsp; Diastolic collapse also occurs in hypovolemic shock, but right ventricular filling pressure is low rather than elevated.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; A dilated left ventricle with apical hypokinesis and engorgement of the inferior vena cava are characteristics of cardiogenic shock.&nbsp; Blunt thoracic trauma may cause myocardial contusion, leading to this scenario; however, evidence of elevated ventricular filling pressure (eg, jugular venous distension) would be expected.&nbsp; As in hypovolemic shock, hypotension, tachycardia, and cold extremities due to peripheral vasoconstriction are present.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis can occur due to massive pulmonary embolism.&nbsp; Such a scenario is unlikely immediately following major thoracic trauma and, if present, should be accompanied by jugular venous distension.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hypovolemic shock involves an initial decrease in preload and cardiac output followed by a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, and ejection fraction.&nbsp; Hypotension, tachycardia, cold extremities, and evidence of hypovolemia (eg, decreased jugular venous pressure) should be present.</p>",
