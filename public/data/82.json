acute mucocutaneous disorder with associated systemic toxicity, following use of sulfonamide antibiotics &ndash; are consistent with <strong>toxic epidermal necrolysis</strong> (TEN).&nbsp; TEN is an inflammatory <strong>hypersensitivity reaction to drugs</strong> (especially sulfonamides [eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as in this patient], nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants and allopurinol) or certain infections (usually <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>).&nbsp; Clinical features of TEN are variable, but typically include <strong>coalescing erythematous </strong>macules, <strong>bullae</strong>, <strong>desquamation</strong>, and <a href=\"1610\">mucositis</a>.&nbsp; Subepidermal and sometimes deeper blistering can be seen.&nbsp; Patches of skin slide off with light pressure (positive Nikolsky sign, also seen in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and pemphigus vulgaris).&nbsp; <strong>Systemic signs</strong> are common and may include fever, tachycardia, hypotension, altered level of consciousness, conjunctivitis, seizures, and coma.&nbsp; The exact pathogenesis is unknown.</p><p>TEN and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are related disorders and may be considered on a continuum of severity.&nbsp; By convention:</p><ul><li>SJS denotes involvement of &lt;10% of body surface area <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</li><li><strong>TEN</strong> denotes <strong>&gt;30%</strong> involvement (as in this patient with lesions on his oral mucosa, back, and most of the visible skin on her entire body).</li><li>10%-30% is referred to as a SJS/TEN overlap syndrome.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The treatment of TEN and SJS is primarily supportive, with wound care similar to that for burns (and often provided in a designated burn unit).&nbsp; Aggressive fluid support is often needed due to poor oral intake and profound cutaneous fluid loss.&nbsp; Secondary infections are common, and antiseptic precautions are needed.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Erythema multiforme (EM) is characterized by sudden onset erythematous rash and <a href=\"1635\">target lesions</a> and usually occurs after a herpes simplex virus infection.&nbsp; EM may appear similar to mild SJS/TEN, but bullae and desquamation are less common, mucosal involvement is rare, and systemic symptoms are not as prominent as in SJS/TEN.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1639\">Exfoliative dermatitis</a> (also known as erythroderma) is a widespread, scaly eruption of the skin.&nbsp; It may be drug-induced, idiopathic, or secondary to an underlying dermatological or systemic disease.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a syndrome of acute exfoliation of skin caused by a toxin that is produced by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.&nbsp; The skin is tender and warm, with a superficial, diffuse erythematous rash (in contrast to the deeper erosions in SJS/TEN).&nbsp; Other features include bullae, positive Nikolsky sign, facial edema, perioral crusting, and dehydration.&nbsp; It is usually seen in children age &lt;6 years and is not associated with recent medication use.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of mucocutaneous lesions and systemic signs of toxicity.&nbsp; Typical features include an erythematous eruption that rapidly evolves into exfoliation of the skin.&nbsp; It is most often caused by medications (eg antibiotics, anticonvulsants, allopurinol).&nbsp; TEN and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are similar disorders distinguished by the percentage of involved skin: SJS involves &lt;10% of the body surface area, TEN involves &gt;30%, and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome involves 10%-30%.</p>",
