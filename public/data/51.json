In association with joint pains and characteristic hand deformities (eg, ulnar deviation, swan neck deformity, nodules), this presentation suggests <strong>rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</strong> complicated by <strong>AA amyloidosis</strong>.&nbsp; Serum amyloid A protein is an acute phase reactant; therefore, AA amyloidosis often develops in the setting of <strong>chronic inflammation</strong> (eg, osteomyelitis, rheumatologic disease).&nbsp; Long-standing RA is the most common cause, and patients with untreated RA are particularly susceptible.</p><p>The most common manifestation of AA amyloidosis is <strong>renal disease</strong> with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome.&nbsp; Skin involvement can lead to thickening or easy bruising (eg, ecchymoses).&nbsp; Cardiac (eg, cardiomyopathy), gastrointestinal (eg, hepatomegaly, dysmotility), and neurologic (eg, peripheral neuropathy, dementia, stroke) disease may also occur.&nbsp; Laboratory studies can show elevated inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and normocytic anemia (due to chronic inflammation).</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of amyloid on tissue biopsy (eg, fat pad).&nbsp; Renal biopsy can be considered if fat pad biopsy is nondiagnostic.&nbsp; Histology demonstrates <strong>amorphous hyaline material</strong> that stains with <strong>Congo red</strong>; green birefringence is noted under polarized light.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Proliferative glomerulonephritis demonstrates cellular proliferation and glomerular immune deposits on histology but usually presents with hypertension, hematuria, and red blood cell casts.&nbsp; In addition, it is typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not RA.&nbsp; Although SLE can cause arthralgias and arthritis (similar to those seen with RA), it typically presents in women of childbearing age and is associated with other findings (eg, thrombocytopenia, ulcers, malar rash).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is characterized by hyalinization of the arterioles and small arteries and results in chronic kidney disease; however, it is caused by long-standing, uncontrolled hypertension (this patient&#39;s blood pressure is normal).&nbsp; In addition, although proteinuria can occur with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, nephrotic-range proteinuria is unexpected (fatty casts on urine microscopy can be seen with nephrotic syndrome, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Acute interstitial nephritis causes renal injury and is classically associated with certain drugs.&nbsp; It can occur with systemic disease (eg, SLE) but is less commonly associated with RA.&nbsp; It is typically characterized by fevers, rash, and urinary white blood cells and white blood cell casts.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Hyperuricemia can result in urate deposition within the renal interstitium and can lead to renal injury, and gout can cause joint pain and deformity.&nbsp; However, urate crystals are expected on urinalysis, and gout flares typically cause a monoarticular arthritis characterized by a warm, swollen, exquisitely painful joint.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s ulnar deviation, swan neck deformity, and nodules are more consistent with RA (distal interphalangeal joint involvement is rare in RA and could suggest concomitant osteoarthritis).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>AA amyloidosis occurs in the setting of chronic inflammation and is most commonly seen in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.&nbsp; The most common manifestation is renal disease characterized by proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome; cardiac and gastrointestinal disease may also occur.&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy demonstrating amorphous hyaline material that stains with Congo red.</p>",

AIN involves antigen hypersensitivity that causes inflammation within the renal interstitium and tubules that leads to tubular accumulation of WBCs (ie, pyuria).&nbsp; Tubular damage may also lead to mild proteinuria and hematuria.</p><p>Patients with AIN are often asymptomatic but may present with nonspecific systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever, <strong>malaise</strong>, <strong>polyarthralgia</strong>, and maculopapular <strong>rash</strong>.&nbsp; AIN is commonly caused by medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proton pump inhibitors.&nbsp; <strong>Allopurinol</strong>, which was given to this patient 2 months ago, is also commonly implicated.&nbsp; AIN is typically diagnosed clinically without the need for a biopsy.&nbsp; Treatment is prompt discontinuation of the offending medication; glucocorticoids are used if the syndrome persists after drug discontinuation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Acute urate nephropathy is characterized by precipitation of uric acid within the renal tubules, which can cause AKI.&nbsp; Unlike AIN, it is not a hypersensitivity response, and it typically occurs in patients with sudden hyperuricemia caused by rapid malignant cell lysis (eg, chemotherapy administration).&nbsp; Long-standing gout may lead to renal dysfunction due to chronic urate nephropathy, but a bland urine sediment (eg, no WBCs) is expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Drug-induced lupus commonly causes malaise, arthralgias, and/or rash (as in this patient).&nbsp; However, AKI is uncommon and is typically caused by glomerulonephritis (eg, red blood cell casts, significant proteinuria) rather than AIN.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; A serum sickness&ndash;like reaction can occur in response to certain medications (eg, allopurinol) and typically manifests with skin rash and arthralgias; however, AKI and peripheral eosinophilia are not expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be caused by a number of medications, including allopurinol, can present with nonspecific systemic symptoms and skin rash.&nbsp; However, the <a href=\"51549\">characteristic rash</a> involves vesicle formation and epidermal detachment (rather than faint and maculopapular, as in this patient).&nbsp; AKI due to SJS is usually prerenal in etiology (ie, due to fluid loss from the skin) with a bland urinalysis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is characterized by acute kidney injury with pyuria and often white blood cell casts in the urine.&nbsp; AIN can be caused by a number of medications (eg, allopurinol) and may be accompanied by nonspecific systemic signs and symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, polyarthralgias, skin rash).</p>",

AKI is often categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Prerenal:&nbsp; characterized by low urine sodium (eg, &lt;20 mEq/L) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio (eg, &gt;20) due to passive urea reabsorption.</p></li><li><p>Postrenal:&nbsp; classically causing hydronephrosis on ultrasound.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intrinsic</strong>:&nbsp; characterized by <strong>high urine sodium</strong> (typically &gt;40 mEq/L) and fractional excretion of sodium (&gt;2%) due to tubular damage limiting reabsorptive capacity; in contrast to prerenal injury, <strong>BUN/creatinine ratio tends to be normal</strong> (~10-15:1).</p></li></ul><p>This patient&#39;s ultrasound findings and chemistry results (eg, high urine sodium, BUN/creatinine ratio ~10:1) make postrenal and prerenal injury unlikely and suggest that his AKI reflects <strong>intrinsic injury</strong>.&nbsp; Although confirmation of the underlying cause of intrinsic renal injury would require further evaluation, the presence of <strong>hypercalcemia</strong> provides an important diagnostic clue.</p><p>Most cases of renal failure result in <em>hypo</em>calcemia due to reduced renal phosphorus excretion; because phosphorous combines with calcium to form calcium phosphate salts, serum calcium levels usually decline.&nbsp; Patients who have acute renal failure and <em>hyper</em>calcemia often have an underlying malignancy that is driving calcium release.&nbsp; This is most often seen in the setting of <strong>multiple myeloma</strong> (MM), which classically presents with anemia, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and acute renal failure.&nbsp; MM-induced hypercalcemia is due to osteoclast activating factors and can cause AKI due to <strong>clogging of the renal tubules</strong> with calcium deposits or immunoglobulin light chains.&nbsp; Glassy light chain casts are often present, but the urinalysis may be bland if cast formation has not yet occurred.&nbsp; Urine dipstick typically demonstrates mild <strong>proteinuria</strong> (only detects albumin); however, a quantitative 24-hour protein assay will show elevated protein excretion (Bence-Jones proteinuria).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; Decreased cardiac output and intravascular volume depletion cause prerenal AKI (eg, BUN/creatinine ratio &gt;20, urine sodium &lt;20 mEq/L).&nbsp; Hypercalcemia-induced diuresis is unlikely in this case due to the presence of moist mucous membrane, which would be uncommon in the setting of significant volume depletion.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; Drug-induced interstitial nephritis is associated with rash, fever, and white blood cells/white blood cell casts on urinalysis, whereas glomerulonephritis is characterized by hematuria with red blood cell casts.&nbsp; None of these conditions are associated with hypercalcemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Progression of diabetic nephropathy typically occurs over a period of years; this significant increase is highly unlikely to occur over 3 months.&nbsp; Although mild proteinuria is common, ultrasound typically demonstrates shrunken, atrophic kidneys, and hypocalcemia (not hypercalcemia) is common.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Damage to the renal tubules causes intrinsic renal failure with limited resorptive capacity.&nbsp; This results in high urine sodium (&gt;40 mEq/L) and a normal blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (~10-15:1).&nbsp; Renal injury usually results in hypocalcemia; the presence of hypercalcemia suggests an underlying malignancy, particularly multiple myeloma.</p>",
