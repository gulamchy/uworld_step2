PH may be idiopathic or due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary vascular disease (eg, thromboembolic), or chest wall disorders (eg, kyphoscoliosis).&nbsp; RHF due to left-sided or congenital heart disease is <strong>not</strong> considered cor pulmonale.&nbsp; <strong>COPD</strong> is the most common cause of cor pulmonale in the United States, with nearly 25% of COPD patients developing this disorder.</p><p>Cor pulmonale typically has a gradual onset but can present acutely due to a sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressures (eg, pulmonary embolism).&nbsp; Patients often develop <strong>exertional</strong> symptoms (eg, dyspnea, angina, syncope).&nbsp; Physical examination may show loud P2 (pulmonic component of the 2nd heart sound), tricuspid regurgitation murmur (holosystolic at the left lower sternal border), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema, hepatomegaly due to hepatic congestion, and possible ascites.&nbsp; COPD patients usually have distant heart sounds due to hyperinflated lungs.&nbsp; End-stage cor pulmonale may present with hypotension, tachycardia, and other signs of cardiogenic shock due to decreased stroke volume.</p><p>Chest x-ray may show enlarged central pulmonary arteries and loss of retrosternal air space due to right ventricular hypertrophy.&nbsp; ECG usually shows right axis deviation, right bundle branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right atrial enlargement.&nbsp; Right heart catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis and typically shows elevated central venous pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (&#8805;25 mm Hg at rest) without left heart disease.&nbsp; Treatment involves optimizing right ventricular dynamics (preload, afterload, and contractility) with supplemental oxygen, diuretics, treatment of underlying etiology, and intravenous inotropes for severe decompensation.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; The cirrhotic liver is characteristically shrunken and fibrotic, but may occasionally be normal-sized or enlarged, and is often accompanied by splenomegaly.&nbsp; Stigmata of chronic liver disease and other symptoms of hepatic decompensation are typically present.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s smoking history, cough, lung findings, and elevated JVP make cor pulmonale due to COPD more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition caused by a rapidly developing pericardial effusion that impairs cardiac filling.&nbsp; Classic findings include jugular venous distension, hypotension, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus (&gt;10 mm Hg decrease in systemic blood pressure with inspiration).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Coronary artery disease may cause <strong>left-sided</strong> or biventricular cardiac failure with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion (eg, pulmonary edema on chest x-ray).&nbsp; Inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause isolated right-sided heart failure; however, these patients typically present with chest pain, nausea, and diaphoresis along with hypotension, elevated jugular venous distension, and clear lungs.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Metastatic carcinoma of the liver can cause hepatomegaly (usually irregular hepatomegaly) and ascites but is not typically associated with dyspnea or elevated JVP, as seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cor pulmonale refers to isolated right-sided heart failure (RHF) from pulmonary hypertension, most commonly due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&nbsp; Signs of RHF include jugular venous distension, increased intensity of P2 (pulmonic component of the 2nd heart sound), right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly, dependent pitting edema, and possible ascites.</p>",

Primary hyperthyroidism can result from:</p><ul><li>overproduction of thyroid hormone (eg, Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter).</li><li>release of <strong>preformed</strong> hormone (eg, painless thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis).</li></ul><p>These etiologies <a href=\"32336\">can be distinguished with <strong>radioactive iodine uptake</strong> (RAIU)</a> scintigraphy, which measures uptake and organification of iodine in the thyroid gland.&nbsp; Uptake is increased in thyrotoxicosis caused by thyroid hormone overproduction (eg, Graves disease) and is low or undetectable in thyrotoxicosis caused by release of preformed hormone.&nbsp; In this patient, the low RAIU and <strong>nontender</strong> goiter are most consistent with <strong>painless (silent) thyroiditis</strong>.</p><p>Painless thyroiditis is associated with <strong>thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies</strong> and is considered a variant of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.&nbsp; (Postpartum thyroiditis is also similar but by definition occurs within &lt;12 months following childbirth.)&nbsp; Following a <a href=\"51264\">self-limited hyperthyroid phase</a>, patients often enter a hypothyroid phase, which may persist or progress to a euthyroid state.&nbsp; Painless thyroiditis does not require specific antithyroid therapy; however, patients with signs of <strong>adrenergic overstimulation</strong> (eg, palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness) should be treated with a <strong>beta blocker</strong> (eg, propranolol) rather than only observation and monitoring <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Levothyroxine is required for patients who develop significant hypothyroidism, but it would not be appropriate now in this patient with overt hyperthyroidism.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and F)</strong>&nbsp; Methimazole decreases thyroid hormone production; RAI causes radiation-induced destruction of thyroid follicular cells.&nbsp; These treatments are used for thyrotoxicosis due to thyroid hormone overproduction but are not helpful for patients with excess release of preformed hormone, as in painless thyroiditis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Prednisone is used to treat thyroid pain refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis.&nbsp; Although subacute thyroiditis is also associated with low RAIU, it presents with a painful, tender goiter and is typically preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection.&nbsp; This patient has a nontender goiter, which is more consistent with painless thyroiditis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Painless thyroiditis is a variant of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis characterized by a self-limited hyperthyroid phase due to release of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a hypothyroid phase or return to a euthyroid state.&nbsp; It does not require specific antithyroid therapy, but patients with hyperadrenergic symptoms (eg, palpitations, tremulousness) should be treated with a beta blocker and receive monitoring of thyroid function.</p>",
