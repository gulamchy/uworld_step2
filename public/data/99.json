In this case, the patient&#39;s ocular pruritus and watery discharge are characteristic of <strong>allergic conjunctivitis</strong>.</p><p>The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to environmental allergens (eg, pet dander, pollen), leading to histamine-induced vasodilation.&nbsp; Manifestations include <strong>bilateral</strong> conjunctival injection, <strong>watery discharge</strong>, and <strong>eyelid edema</strong>; light crusting can occur.&nbsp; <strong>Ocular pruritus</strong> is a key symptom and often helps differentiate allergic conjunctivitis from a viral cause.&nbsp; Patients may have a burning sensation with rubbing, but pain, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia are not expected.&nbsp; Symptom onset and duration are variable and depend on allergen exposure (eg, transient, seasonal, or perennial); a definitive allergen may not always be identified.</p><p>The diagnosis is clinical and more common in those with other atopic diseases, such as eczema in this patient.&nbsp; Treatment options include <strong>topical antihistamines</strong> (eg, olopatadine, ketotifen), <strong>mast cell stabilizers</strong>, and allergen avoidance, when possible.&nbsp; Cool compresses are also typically recommended to induce vasoconstriction, and oral antihistamines can help patients with concomitant allergic rhinitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Fluorescein staining allows visualization of corneal abrasions, which are caused by epithelial trauma and lead to acute, severe pain and photophobia;

This patient has symptoms limited to the eyelids and conjunctivae.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Topical trimethoprim-polymyxin is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, which typically causes conjunctival injection with thick, purulent (not watery) discharge.&nbsp; Although bacterial conjunctivitis can affect both eyes, it typically begins in one and can then spread to the other, unlike the bilateral findings at symptom onset in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Warm compresses may alleviate symptoms of viral conjunctivitis, which causes conjunctival injection and watery discharge; history may also reveal a contact with viral symptoms.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s ocular pruritus makes allergic conjunctivitis more likely, and warm compresses would likely worsen histamine-mediated vasodilation.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Allergic conjunctivitis presents with bilateral conjunctival injection, watery discharge, eyelid edema, and ocular pruritus due to histamine-induced vasodilation.&nbsp;

Conjunctivitis is characterized by inflammation of the <a href=\"3748\">conjunctiva</a>, the mucous membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids (tarsal conjunctiva) and anterior sclera (bulbar conjunctiva).</p><p>Common causes of acute conjunctivitis include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Allergic conjunctivitis</strong>:&nbsp; Patients develop <strong>bilateral</strong> conjunctival injection and <strong>watery discharge</strong>, as seen in this case.&nbsp; Because this condition is due to a type I hypersensitivity reaction to environmental allergens (eg, pollen, dust), <strong>ocular pruritus</strong> is characteristic and begins soon after exposure to the allergen, which may not always be readily identifiable; the <strong>sudden symptom onset</strong> in this case is consistent with the diagnosis.&nbsp; <strong>Eyelid edema</strong> (due to histamine release and rubbing) is common, and the tarsal conjunctiva may have a nonspecific, <strong>granular (follicular or &#x22;bumpy&#x22;)</strong> appearance due to lymphoid aggregates.&nbsp; Findings suggestive of other atopic conditions, such as allergic rhinitis (eg, rhinorrhea, sneezing) and asthma (eg, wheezing), may be present (as in this patient) and are also often triggered by environmental allergens.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"62344\">Viral conjunctivitis</a>:&nbsp; Like allergic conjunctivitis, patients develop watery discharge and granular tarsal conjunctiva; upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea) usually accompany ocular findings.&nbsp; In contrast to allergic conjunctivitis, ocular pruritus is uncommon, making this diagnosis less likely in this patient <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.&nbsp; Moreover, viral infections often start with unilateral conjunctival injection and involve the contralateral side within 1-2 days.</p></li><li><p>Bacterial conjunctivitis:&nbsp; Symptoms classically include unilateral conjunctival injection with thick, purulent discharge that reaccumulates within minutes of wiping; contralateral involvement often occurs within 1-2 days <strong>(Choices D)</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>The presence of severe pain, photophobia, or blurry vision (none of which is seen in this patient) should raise concern for a diagnosis other than conjunctivitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Inflammation of the anterior uveal tract causes iritis (or <a href=\"60709\">anterior uveitis</a>).&nbsp; Redness of the eye is often associated with pain, photophobia, and decreased visual acuity, none of which are seen in this patient.&nbsp; In addition, discharge and pruritus are not expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a form of allergic conjunctivitis in which redness, pruritus, and tearing are common, but patients have chronic (not acute) symptoms, often with photophobia and a foreign body sensation.&nbsp; Moreover, signs of chronic eyelid inflammation (eg, thickened, lichenified skin) are typical.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Acute allergic conjunctivitis causes bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge and granular (follicular) tarsal conjunctiva.&nbsp; Ocular pruritus is a key feature that distinguishes allergic conjunctivitis from viral conjunctivitis.</p>",

<a href=\"53870\">Acute dacryocystitis</a> is typically caused by <a href=\"54608\">nasolacrimal duct</a>&nbsp;<strong>obstruction</strong>, which leads to stasis of tears in the nasolacrimal sac, predisposing it to <strong>infection</strong>.&nbsp; As the nasolacrimal sac becomes inflamed, it causes tenderness, <strong>erythema</strong>, and <strong>swelling</strong> of the overlying skin and soft tissue; <strong>purulent discharge</strong> can often be expressed from the punctum.&nbsp; Because the infection does not directly infect the globe, patients typically have normal visual acuity.</p><p>Dacryocystitis requires urgent diagnosis and treatment or it can progress to periorbital or orbital cellulitis, sepsis, or meningitis.&nbsp; Treatment includes <strong>systemic antibiotic therapy</strong> with good gram-positive coverage, especially against <em>Staphylococcus</em> species.&nbsp; Ophthalmology consultation is recommended to ensure proper treatment.&nbsp; Incision and drainage of the nasolacrimal sac or surgical correction of the nasolacrimal duct obstruction may be indicated in severe cases.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"54782\">Chalazion</a> results from chronic, granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland in the eyelid.&nbsp; In contrast to this patient with dacryocystitis, patients with a chalazion typically have a rubbery, painless nodule with no associated purulent drainage.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"54783\">Episcleritis</a> refers to inflammation or infection of the episclera, the thin, connective tissue between the conjunctiva and sclera.&nbsp; Rather than the medial canthus, the globe is involved, with diffuse or localized bulbar conjunctival injection seen on examination.&nbsp; Affected patients typically have mild-to-moderate discomfort, photophobia, and watery discharge.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"34815\">Hordeolum</a> refers to an acute, focal infection of the eyelid.&nbsp; External hordeola (ie, sties), which result from blockage of a sebaceous or sweat gland, are most common.&nbsp; They typically present with a tender pustule or nodule at the eyelid margin; localized swelling and erythema may be present but do not typically extend into the medial canthal region, where the lacrimal sac is located.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"49419\">Orbital cellulitis</a> can cause eyelid erythema, edema, and tenderness, but these findings are typically more diffuse (vs localized to the medial canthal region).&nbsp; Because orbital cellulitis involves infection extending beyond the <a href=\"54607\">orbital septum</a> into the periorbital fat and extraocular muscles, impaired or painful extraocular movements are also commonly present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Acute dacryocystitis, an infection of the nasolacrimal sac, typically presents with pain, swelling, and erythema over the medial canthus.&nbsp;
