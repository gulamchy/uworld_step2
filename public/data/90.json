Although delineation of the underlying organism typically requires stool and blood evaluation, a specific diagnosis is often suspected based on the quality (eg, watery or bloody, small or large volume) and frequency of the diarrhea.</p><p>In this case, the presence of low-grade fever, abdominal pain, intermittent <strong>bloody stools</strong>, and a <strong>CD4 count &lt;50/mm</strong><font size=\"2\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></font> raises strong suspicion for <strong>cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis</strong>.&nbsp; CMV is a common opportunistic pathogen in patients with untreated AIDS; it is most prone to attack the retina and gastrointestinal system.&nbsp; CMV colitis generally presents with progressive fatigue, <strong>low-grade fever</strong>, weight loss, and <strong>frequent, low-volume, bloody stools</strong>.&nbsp; As with other causes of diarrhea, hypokalemia may be present but is nonspecific.</p><p>Diagnosis is typically made using <strong>colonoscopy</strong> with biopsy (eosinophilic intranuclear and basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions).&nbsp; Although most patients with CMV colitis have evidence of CMV viremia, the presence of viremia cannot be used to diagnose end-organ disease (because viremia can occur without end-organ damage).&nbsp; Treatment with ganciclovir improves symptoms, but patients require antiretroviral therapy to prevent relapse.&nbsp; All patients with active CMV also require an ocular examination to rule out concurrent retinitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cryptosporidiosis is a common cause of chronic, profuse, watery diarrhea in patients with AIDS who have CD4 counts &lt;180/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>.&nbsp; This pathogen does not typically cause bloody stools.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> can cause bloody stools and fever but most often is acquired during international travel in countries with poor sanitation.&nbsp; It is not a common opportunistic pathogen in patients with AIDS in the United States.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Giardia</em> causes malabsorptive, watery diarrhea.&nbsp; It can become chronic and result in significant weight loss (10%-20% or more) in patients with AIDS.&nbsp; However, it does not typically cause bloody stools.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Herpes simplex is usually associated with painful esophagitis or genital lesions in patients with HIV.&nbsp; It is an uncommon cause of colitis compared with CMV.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Kaposi sarcoma (KS) of the gastrointestinal tract can cause hematochezia, but fevers would be less likely.&nbsp; AIDS-related KS is much more common among men who have sex with men than among other populations with HIV (eg, intravenous drug users).</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Disseminated <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex infection can cause chronic diarrhea and weight loss; however, the diarrhea is typically watery, not bloody.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with AIDS who have CD4 counts &lt;50/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font> are at high risk for infectious colitis with opportunistic bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens.&nbsp; Cytomegalovirus colitis should be suspected in those with frequent, small-volume, bloody stools and abdominal pain.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy.&nbsp; Any patient with HIV who has active CMV disease requires ocular examination to rule out concurrent retinitis.</p>",

The majority of acute viral encephalitis cases are due to unknown causes.&nbsp; However, herpes viruses (eg, herpes simplex, varicella, Epstein-Barr) most commonly cause encephalitis in immunocompetent adults.&nbsp; Patients typically present with <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>altered mental status</strong>, agitation, headaches, and seizures that can rapidly progress to complete unresponsiveness or coma.&nbsp; Examination can show <strong>neurologic abnormalities</strong>, including hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes.&nbsp; Clinical signs of meningeal irritation (eg, photophobia, <strong>nuchal rigidity</strong>) are <strong>usually absent</strong> in patients with pure encephalitis.</p><p>Lumbar puncture usually shows cerebrospinal fluid <a href=\"684\">(CSF) findings</a> of <strong>elevated white blood cell count</strong> with <strong>lymphocytic predominance</strong>, normal to slightly elevated <strong>protein</strong> concentration (generally 100 mg/dL), and normal glucose.&nbsp; Most patients have an increased red blood cell count as well.&nbsp; Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detecting viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF.&nbsp; <strong>Empiric</strong> treatment with <strong>intravenous acyclovir</strong> should be started while awaiting PCR results as encephalitis is often associated with significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous amphotericin (plus flucytosine) is used for induction therapy in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.&nbsp; Cryptococcal meningitis is usually a subacute meningitis, and patients commonly present after weeks of symptoms.&nbsp; It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients (eg, those with HIV).&nbsp; Symptoms are due to increased intracranial pressures (headache) from capsular swelling; almost all patients have markedly elevated opening pressure on spinal tap.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s rapid onset of symptoms, presentation more consistent with encephalitis, and normal opening pressure make cryptococcal meningitis very unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin (and ampicillin in adults age &gt;50) are empiric treatments for bacterial meningitis.&nbsp; CSF analysis in these patients typically shows elevated white blood cell counts with neutrophil predominance, elevated protein concentration (often &gt;250 mg/dL), and low glucose.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; CT scan of the head does not always show abnormalities in patients with encephalitis and is typically done to exclude a space-occupying lesion.&nbsp; MRI of the brain is sensitive for detection of demyelination or other focal abnormalities of the temporal lobe that suggest herpes simplex virus encephalitis.&nbsp; However, empiric treatment with intravenous acyclovir should be started as soon as possible in patients with suspected viral encephalitis without waiting for further imaging studies.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Chlordiazepoxide is used to treat alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized patients.&nbsp; Withdrawal can begin within 1-2 days of stopping alcohol and presents with tremulousness, anxiety, headache, and palpitations.&nbsp; These can progress to fever, hypertension, and delirium tremens.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s CSF findings (eg, elevated protein &amp; WBC), however, are more suggestive of viral encephalitis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Viral encephalitis can present with cerebrospinal fluid findings of elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytic predominance, elevated red blood cell count, normal glucose, and normal to slightly elevated protein concentration.&nbsp; Early empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir should be initiated as soon as possible for suspected herpes simplex virus encephalitis until confirmatory tests return.</p>",

The illness usually begins with nonspecific upper respiratory tract symptoms and progresses to characteristic findings of <strong>hoarseness</strong>, stridor, and a <a href=\"1806\">barking, seal-like cough</a> due to upper airway edema.&nbsp; The stridor is typically <strong>inspiratory</strong> (may be biphasic in severe cases) but may not be detected if the child is calm, as seen in this case, because patients with mild croup develop stridor only when airway narrowing is exacerbated by agitation (eg, crying) or excitement.&nbsp;

This patient has stridor in the setting of infectious signs and symptoms (ie, fever, congestion, rhinorrhea), which makes croup more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Retropharyngeal abscess is a deep neck space infection that presents with fever, dysphagia, neck pain/stiffness, and a muffled voice.&nbsp; A large abscess compromising the airway can lead to stridor, but posterior pharyngeal swelling would be expected on examination, and cough does not occur.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Croup is a common viral respiratory infection that should be suspected in a young child (age 6 months to 3 years) with acute-onset stridor and a harsh, barking cough in the setting of infectious signs and symptoms (eg, fever, rhinorrhea).</p>",
