Given his history of heavy alcohol use and recurrent epigastric abdominal pain, this presentation suggests chronic pancreatitis resulting in a <strong>pancreaticopleural fistula</strong> (PPF).</p><p><strong>Pancreatic fistulas</strong> are caused by a disruption of the pancreatic ducts, resulting in leakage of pancreatic digestive enzymes.&nbsp; They are most commonly due to acute or <strong>chronic pancreatitis</strong> and typically result in the formation of an internal fistula (ie, communication with hollow viscera, pleural/peritoneal cavities).&nbsp; Iatrogenic fistulas can occur after percutaneous drainage of pancreatic cysts or abscesses and typically result in external fistulas (ie, communication with the skin).</p><p>Fistulas involving the pleural cavity enable pancreatic fluid to enter the pleural space.&nbsp; The resultant <strong>pleural effusion</strong> is <strong>exudative</strong> by Light criteria and <strong>amylase-rich</strong> (ie, pleural fluid amylase exceeding upper limit of normal for serum amylase or a pleural-fluid-to-serum-amylase ratio &gt;1).&nbsp; The pH is typically 7.3-7.5.&nbsp; Manifestations include cough, dyspnea, dysphagia, and chest pain; however, some patients can be asymptomatic.&nbsp; Examination demonstrates decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion of the affected lung.</p><p>PPFs tend to recur after thoracentesis.&nbsp; Management includes <strong>bowel rest</strong> to avoid pancreatic stimulation, enabling the PPF to close.&nbsp; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and/or stent placement may be required to promote drainage of pancreatic fluid through the ampulla of Vater instead of the fistula.&nbsp; Refractory cases require percutaneous drainage or surgery.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; In patients with cirrhosis, a unilateral pleural effusion (eg, hepatic hydrothorax) can develop but is generally right-sided and transudative and would not exhibit high amylase levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Heavy alcohol use can result in a dilated cardiomyopathy, and volume overload would typically result in bilateral, transudative pleural effusions.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and F)</strong>&nbsp; Empyema and pulmonary tuberculosis are exudative processes; however, both typically result in a low pH (&lt;7.30) and a markedly elevated amylase is unexpected.&nbsp; Tuberculous effusions also typically demonstrate an elevated adenosine deaminase level.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; An esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) results in an amylase-rich exudative pleural effusion; however, the pleural fluid pH is typically very low (&lt;6), and undigested food may be present.&nbsp; In addition, Boerhaave syndrome typically occurs in the setting of severe vomiting and chest pain is expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>A pancreaticopleural fistula (between the pancreatic duct and the pleural space) resulting in an amylase-rich exudative pleural effusion&nbsp;occurs most commonly as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis.&nbsp; Management includes bowel rest to promote fistula closure; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may be required.</p>",

The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol use and gallstones.&nbsp; Although pregnancy increases the risk for gallstones (progesterone-related decreased gallbladder motility), this patient has a normal right upper quadrant ultrasound (eg, no biliary sludge, no dilation of the biliary tree).</p><p>After alcohol and gallstones have been excluded, other less common causes of acute pancreatitis (eg, hypercalcemia, <strong>hypertriglyceridemia</strong>) should be explored.&nbsp; Triglyceride levels typically increase two- to four-fold in pregnancy, particularly in the <strong>third trimester</strong> (increased triglyceride-rich lipoprotein production and decreased lipoprotein lipase activity).&nbsp; In this patient with hypertriglyceridemia who discontinued fibrate therapy in pregnancy, this effect is likely compounded.</p><p>A <strong>lipid panel</strong> showing a <strong>triglyceride level &gt;1000 mg/dL</strong>&nbsp;is required for diagnosis of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis and has implications on patient management:&nbsp; In addition to intravenous fluid therapy and pain control (used in any case of acute pancreatitis), management of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis may include insulin infusion (limits fatty-acid release from adipocytes) or apheresis (removes triglyceride-rich plasma).&nbsp; Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity (eg, sepsis, preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal demise) and requires hospitalization.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Uncomplicated acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process that does not benefit from antibiotics.&nbsp; Antibiotics are used for infected pancreatic necrosis or extrapancreatic infection, which typically develop days following pancreatitis onset and are unlikely in this afebrile, hemodynamically stable patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pancreatitis can be diagnosed in the presence of 2 of 3 classic features:&nbsp;classic symptoms (eg, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back);&nbsp;elevated amylase/lipase;&nbsp;or characteristic imaging findings.&nbsp; This patient with classic symptoms and laboratory findings does <strong>not</strong> require a CT scan, particularly given that she is pregnant and that imaging would not affect management at this time (vs lipid panel, which may indicate the need for insulin infusion or apheresis).&nbsp; If her condition worsens (eg, hemodynamic decompensation, persistent fevers), imaging may be performed to exclude complications (eg, infected necrosis) or other serious processes.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is used to evaluate choledocholithiasis, which can cause biliary pancreatitis.&nbsp; Although patients with choledocholithiasis sometimes have no biliary tree dilation on ultrasound, they typically have biliary sludge and residual gallstones; and gallstone pancreatitis is classically associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (&gt;150 U/L).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Preeclampsia (eg, elevated urine protein/creatinine ratio) can present with epigastric pain but would cause hypertension (ie, systolic &#8805;140 mm Hg, diastolic &#8805;90 mm Hg).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pregnant patients, particularly those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia, are at increased risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis.&nbsp; A serum lipid panel can confirm hypertriglyceridemia as the underlying etiology.</p>",

Approximately 15%-25% of patients with acute pancreatitis develop <strong>severe acute pancreatitis</strong> (SAP), defined as pancreatitis that causes <strong>failure of &#8805;1 organ systems</strong> (eg, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular) lasting &gt;48 hours.&nbsp; Important <strong>clinical predictors</strong> of SAP, associated with a worse prognosis, include the following:</p><ul><li><p>Signs of <a href=\"37319\">systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)</a> (eg, temperature &gt;38 C [100.4 F], leukocytes &gt;12,000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)</strong> (&gt;20 mg/dL), creatinine (&gt;1.8 mg/dL), and/or hematocrit (&gt;44%), which reflect <strong>intravascular volume depletion</strong> (with hemoconcentration) due to third spacing of fluid caused by the inflammatory response and increased capillary permeability</p></li><li><p>Radiologic findings demonstrating <strong>third spacing of fluid</strong>, such as pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions (eg, decreased breath sounds at the bases)</p></li></ul><p>Patient characteristics that predict a worse prognosis include older age (&gt;55) and medical comorbidities, particularly obesity (BMI &gt;30 kg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>) <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</p><p>These factors are incorporated into clinical prediction scores (eg, SIRS score, Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis [BISAP], Ranson criteria), which can help guide management.&nbsp; BUN levels are particularly reliable in predicting mortality, and fluid resuscitation rates can be adjusted to ensure decreases in these levels.&nbsp; Because patients with SAP have increased morbidity and mortality, they typically require admission to the intensive care unit.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Epigastric tenderness, voluntary guarding (ie, muscle contraction during palpation to minimize pain), and ileus (eg, mild abdominal distension, decreased bowel sounds) are relatively common findings in acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; Unlike rebound tenderness, involuntary guarding (ie, muscle rigidity regardless of palpation), or diffuse abdominal tenderness, these examination findings do not indicate severe disease.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Elevated hematocrit (eg, &gt;44%), caused by hemoconcentration from third spacing of fluid, is associated with increased disease severity in acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; In contrast, normal or low levels (eg, 37% in this patient) at the time of hospital admission are usually predictive of a milder disease course.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; An elevated lipase level (&gt;3 times normal limit) is part of the initial diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis (classic epigastric pain radiating to the back; elevated amylase/lipase; characteristic imaging findings).&nbsp; However, neither the absolute lipase value nor the trend (serial measurements) predicts SAP.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) occurs in 15%-25% of patients with acute pancreatitis and causes failure of &#8805;1 organ systems lasting &gt;48 hours.&nbsp; Predictors of SAP include signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and evidence (eg, elevated blood urea nitrogen or hematocrit) of intravascular volume depletion.&nbsp; Patients have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality and usually require intensive monitoring.</p>",

Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following criteria: acute onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, increased amylase or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic abdominal imaging findings (eg, focal or diffuse pancreatic enlargement).</p><p>Early in pancreatitis, the pancreas synthesizes digestive enzymes but cannot secrete them.&nbsp; These enzymes leak out of the acinar cells into the systemic circulation.&nbsp; Amylase rises within 6-12 hours of symptom onset and may remain elevated for 3-5 days.&nbsp; Lipase rises within 4-8 hours of symptom onset but remains elevated longer than amylase (8-14 days).&nbsp; As a result, lipase is more useful and sensitive than amylase for diagnosis (especially in alcoholics and patients presenting later in the disease course).</p><p>Imaging is not required for diagnosis in patients with typical abdominal pain and significantly elevated amylase and/or lipase.&nbsp; Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen may be performed in patients with unclear diagnosis or in those who fail to improve with conservative management (to identify infection or necrosis).&nbsp; This patient has characteristic abdominal pain and would first need laboratory testing.&nbsp; If the diagnosis is still unclear, he may require imaging such as abdominal computed tomography scan <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong> &nbsp;Abdominal ultrasound may reveal a classic diffusely enlarged and hypoechoic pancreas in acute pancreatitis. &nbsp;However, nearly 30% of patients have an ileus with bowel gas that prevents full visualization of the pancreas and may not clearly identify inflammation or necrosis.&nbsp; Once the diagnosis of pancreatitis is confirmed, ultrasound may be useful to identify certain causes (eg, gallstones).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Abdominal x-rays may be normal in mild pancreatitis or show nonspecific ileus in severe disease.&nbsp; In either case, they are not as useful for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. &nbsp;An upright chest x-ray, however, might be useful in this patient as it could show air under the diaphragm if there were suspicion for bowel perforation.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not indicated for the routine diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; However, early ERCP for suspected biliary pancreatitis may decrease morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; ERCP is also effective for evaluating patients with recurrent pancreatitis or draining pancreatic pseudocysts.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Uncomplicated patients with acute onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and increased amylase or lipase (&gt;3 times normal) do not need confirmatory imaging for diagnosing acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen may be performed in patients with unclear diagnosis or those who fail to improve with conservative management. &nbsp;Abdominal ultrasound may identify gallstones as the cause of pancreatitis.</p>",
