MVP classically causes a midsystolic click often followed by a <a href=\"15927\">holosystolic murmur</a> of mitral regurgitation (MR).&nbsp; Unlike most cardiac murmurs, the MVP murmur becomes <em>less</em> prominent when ventricular blood volume is increased (eg, squatting, passive leg raise).</p><p>MVP typically results from myxomatous degeneration of the chordae tendineae and valve leaflets; this leads to abnormal displacement of the leaflets into the left atrium (ie, prolapse) during valve closure, often with MR.&nbsp; During systole, left ventricular (LV) cavity size decreases, and there&nbsp;is a <a href=\"24563\">critical LV blood volume</a> at which the leaflets become overextended and&nbsp;prolapse into the left atrium, creating the audible <strong>click</strong> followed by a <strong>murmur of MR</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Decreased LV blood volume (eg, standing, Valsalva strain phase) increases the available slack in the valve apparatus.&nbsp; This causes this critical volume to be reached earlier in systole, creating an early systolic click followed by a longer/more prominent MR murmur.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased LV blood volume</strong>&nbsp;(eg, <strong>squatting</strong>) causes this critical volume to be reached <strong>later in systole</strong> (or not at all), creating a late systolic click (that may not be heard at all) followed by a shorter/<strong>less prominent MR murmur</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>In some cases, the click and murmur may disappear altogether.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; A bicuspid aortic valve can lead to aortic stenosis or sometimes aortic regurgitation.&nbsp; Rheumatic fever most commonly causes mitral stenosis but can cause MR.&nbsp; These murmurs increase in intensity with an increase in LV blood volume (increased flow through the valve).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Infective endocarditis of the mitral valve is expected to cause MR.&nbsp; However, MR not associated with MVP causes a holosystolic murmur that intensifies with increased LV blood volume (ie, does not depend on the valve prolapsing and intensifies due to increased flow).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; A ventricular septal defect causes a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases in intensity with the increase in LV afterload (and blood volume) that occurs with squatting.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Mitral valve prolapse is recognized by a midsystolic click often followed by a mitral regurgitation murmur .&nbsp; The timing of the click (and murmur) depends on left ventricular blood volume; increased left ventricular blood volume (eg, squatting) cause the click (and murmur) to become less prominent, occurring later in systole or disappearing altogether.</p>",

<strong>Innocent murmurs</strong> are common in children and generally represent turbulent <strong>blood flow</strong> through a <strong>structurally normal heart</strong>.&nbsp; Features of benign murmurs include <strong>grade 1-2</strong> intensity, <strong>early or midsystolic</strong> timing, and a vibratory or musical quality.&nbsp; Unremarkable vital signs and lack of symptoms (eg, no chest pain or exertional dyspnea) are characteristic.&nbsp; Splitting of S2 during inspiration is a normal finding.</p><p>Common <a href=\"63651\">innocent murmurs</a> include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Still murmur</strong>:&nbsp; systolic, <strong>vibratory</strong>, best heard over <strong>left lower sternal border</strong>, &#8593; intensity when supine</li><li>Pulmonic flow murmur:&nbsp; systolic ejection, best heard over left upper sternal border, may radiate to axilla</li><li>Venous hum:&nbsp; continuous, best heard over the supra- or infraclavicular area, &#8595; intensity with neck rotation</li></ul><p>This patient&#39;s examination is consistent with a Still murmur, the most common innocent murmur in young children.&nbsp; The pathogenesis of a Still murmur is unclear, but it is thought to be related to turbulent left ventricular outflow.&nbsp; Maneuvers that decrease venous blood return to the heart (eg, standing, Valsalva maneuvers) are associated with reduced intensity (or disappearance) of a Still murmur, as seen here.&nbsp; Management is <strong>reassurance</strong>, and a Still murmur typically resolves by adolescence.</p><p><strong>(Choices A, B, and C)</strong>&nbsp; ECG and echocardiogram are indicated for murmurs associated with pathologic features (eg, grade &#8805;3, holosystolic or diastolic, harsh) to assess for congenital heart defects or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).&nbsp; HCM causes a murmur that increases, rather than decreases as in this patient, with standing because decreased venous return increases left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.&nbsp; Symptomatic patients (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, syncope) with a murmur also warrant cardiac evaluation, often including chest x-ray to evaluate heart size or pulmonary abnormalities.&nbsp; This patient is asymptomatic with no pathologic murmur features, making further evaluation unnecessary.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Aortic coarctation can cause a continuous murmur best heard over the back that results from flow through compensatory collateral vasculature; lower extremity blood pressure is decreased relative to upper extremity measurements.&nbsp; Expected findings include weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension, neither of which is seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Innocent cardiac murmurs result from physiologic blood flow within a structurally normal heart and are typically grade 1-2 intensity, early or midsystolic in timing, and musical or vibratory in quality.&nbsp; A Still murmur is an innocent, vibratory, systolic ejection murmur best heard along the lower left sternal border, and management is reassurance.</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p>An intense holosystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex is consistent with <strong>severe mitral regurgitation</strong> (MR).&nbsp; Due to backflow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) to the left atrium during systole, the total amount of blood entering the LV during diastole is increased.&nbsp; To compensate for the <strong>increased volume load</strong>, the LV undergoes eccentric hypertrophy and <strong>LV cavity dilation</strong>.&nbsp; Patients initially develop symptoms (eg, dyspnea on exertion) due to decreased cardiac output (the lungs are clear during this time).&nbsp; Further progression can lead to decompensated heart failure with increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema.</p><p>An <strong>audible S3 gallop</strong> is an expected finding in patients with severe MR.&nbsp; It results from <strong>reverberation of the walls</strong> of the <strong>dilated LV</strong> during the passive filling phase of diastole.&nbsp; The S3 is present prior to the development of decompensated heart failure, and the absence of an S3 helps exclude severe chronic MR.&nbsp; An S3 is also commonly heard with decompensated heart failure of any etiology.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Finger clubbing can result from chronic hypoxemia, such as occurs in disorders with right-to-left intracardiac shunting (eg, tetralogy of Fallot).&nbsp; MR causes dyspnea due to reduced cardiac output; significant hypoxemia is unlikely unless there is pulmonary edema (this patient&#39;s lungs are clear on auscultation).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; An opening snap occurs with mitral stenosis.&nbsp; It can be appreciated just after S2, as the stenotic mitral valve opens at the beginning of diastole.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; An S4 is often heard in patients with concentric LV hypertrophy due to systemic hypertension or severe aortic stenosis.&nbsp; It is caused by blood striking a stiff left ventricle during atrial systole, just before mitral valve closure (S1).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Uvular pulsation (M&uuml;ller&#39;s sign) may be appreciated with the high-amplitude systolic pulsation and rapid diastolic collapse that occurs with severe aortic regurgitation.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Wide and fixed <a href=\"20481\">splitting of S2</a> occurs with an atrial septal defect.&nbsp; Because blood passes from the left atrium into the right atrium, blood flow increases across the pulmonic valve during systole, resulting in delayed pulmonic valve closure (wide splitting).&nbsp; The communication between the atria also causes equilibration of left atrial and right atrial pressures and eliminates respiratory variation in the splitting of S2 (fixed).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with severe mitral regurgitation develop left ventricular volume overload and LV dilation, with an audible S3 gallop typically present.</p>",

Patients with AS are usually asymptomatic for a prolonged period, with <strong>classic symptoms</strong> typically occurring only after progression to severe AS (valve area usually &lt;1 cm<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>).&nbsp; Classic symptoms of severe AS include the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exercise intolerance</strong> and <strong>exertional dyspnea</strong>:&nbsp; Severe valvular stenosis obstructs left ventricular outflow, preventing an increase in cardiac output during exercise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exertional angina</strong>:&nbsp; Left ventricular hypertrophy (as seen on this patient&#39;s ECG) compensates for the increased afterload caused by the stenosed aortic valve.&nbsp; On exertion, oxygen delivery is inadequate (due to inability to appropriately increase cardiac output) to supply the increased oxygen requirements of the hypertrophied myocardium, resulting in angina.</p></li><li><p><strong>Presyncope</strong> (ie, <strong>lightheadness</strong>) or syncope:&nbsp; Cerebral perfusion pressure decreases during exercise because cardiac output cannot increase sufficiently to offset the decrease in systemic vascular resistance that occurs with exercise-induced peripheral vasodilation.</p></li></ul><p>Transthoracic <strong>echocardiography</strong> should be obtained in all patients with suspected AS to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of AS, and evaluate left ventricular size and function.&nbsp; Failure to treat severe AS can lead to irreversible heart failure and sudden death.&nbsp; Definitive treatment is surgical valve replacement.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; 24-hour ECG monitoring can detect paroxysmal arrhythmias (eg, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response) that may cause presyncope.&nbsp; However, the consistent association of this patient&#39;s symptoms with exertion and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG are more suggestive of AS than of intermittent arrhythmias.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Carotid stenosis (which can be evaluated with carotid ultrasound) can lead to decreased cerebral perfusion, which rarely presents with lightheadedness on exertion.&nbsp; However, it would not explain this patient&#39;s exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Upright tilt table testing may be used to diagnose orthostatic or vasovagal syncope in patients with recurrent unexplained syncope.&nbsp; However, other more dangerous causes (eg, structural heart disease) of presyncope/syncope should be ruled out first.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Exercise stress testing is considered when exertional symptoms (eg, angina, dyspnea) occur in the setting of known or suspected coronary artery disease.&nbsp; However, severe, symptomatic AS is a contraindication for exercise stress testing due to the risk of complications, including syncope and death; therefore, echocardiography should be performed first when severe AS is suspected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Symptoms of severe aortic stenosis include exercise intolerance, exertional dyspnea and angina, and exertional presyncope/syncope.&nbsp;
