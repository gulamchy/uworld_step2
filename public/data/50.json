Common physical examination findings in HCM include a prominent LV impulse, an S4, and a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.</p><p>Many patients with HCM have <strong>dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction</strong> that varies with changes in <a href=\"19605\">LV blood volume</a>.&nbsp; The obstruction is worsened by relatively low LV blood volume and improved by high LV blood volume; therefore, <strong>management</strong> aims to maintain relatively high LV blood volume.&nbsp; One way this is accomplished is via <strong>avoidance of dehydration</strong>.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>medications</strong> with negative chronotropy and negative inotropy benefit HCM by increasing LV blood volume in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Negative chronotropy</strong> slows heart rate to increase LV filling time and LV end-diastolic volume.</p></li><li><p><strong>Negative inotropy</strong> reduces LV contractility to allow systolic blood ejection to complete at a higher LV blood volume (ie, increased LV end-systolic blood volume)</p></li></ul><p>These effects <strong>increase LV blood volume</strong> throughout the cardiac cycle to help reduce outflow tract obstruction.&nbsp; <strong>Beta blockers</strong> (eg, metoprolol) are usually first-line therapy; however, they are relatively contraindicated in patients with obstructive lung disease (eg, asthma).&nbsp; In patients with HCM and a contraindication to beta blockers, <strong>verapamil</strong>&nbsp;is often used to decrease chronotropy and inotropy.&nbsp; Diltiazem, the other commonly used nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has systemic vasodilatory effects that make it somewhat less preferable for HCM.</p><p><strong>(Choices A, C, and D)</strong>&nbsp; Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) and ACE inhibitors&nbsp;(eg, lisinopril) tend to worsen HCM symptoms by causing vasodilation of both venules and arterioles.&nbsp; The decreased preload (caused by venular dilation) and decreased afterload (caused by arteriolar dilation) both decrease LV blood volume to worsen outflow tract obstruction.&nbsp; Similarly, venous dilation with nitrates (eg, isosorbide mononitrate) worsens LV outflow tract obstruction in HCM (via decreased preload).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Aspirin is indicated for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients age 50-70, but it is generally not indicated for those age &lt;50 because the protective cardiovascular benefit may be too small to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Negative chronotropy and negative inotropy are beneficial in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as they increase left ventricular blood volume throughout the cardiac cycle to reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.&nbsp; Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) are first-line therapy for this purpose, and verapamil is a suitable alternative.</p>",

Cor pulmonale refers to impaired function of the right ventricle caused by <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong> that occurs due to underlying diseases of the lungs (COPD, interstitial lung disease), pulmonary vasculature (idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension), or obstructive sleep apnea.&nbsp; By convention, right ventricular dysfunction due to left heart disease or congenital heart disease is <strong>not</strong> considered cor pulmonale.</p><p>Patients with cor pulmonale typically present with exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, angina, syncope), anorexia or abdominal pain (due to hepatic congestion), and peripheral edema.&nbsp; Physical examination may show a loud P2 (pulmonic component of 2nd heart sound) and a right ventricular 3rd heart sound, tricuspid regurgitation murmur (holosystolic at the left lower sternal border, augments with inspiration), elevated jugular venous pressure with hepatojugular reflux, hepatomegaly with pulsatile liver, and occasionally ascites or pleural effusion.&nbsp; The diagnosis of cor pulmonale is based primarily on clinical features and echocardiographic findings (eg, right ventricular hypertrophy, tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial enlargement).&nbsp; If necessary, definitive diagnosis can be made using right heart catheterization showing <strong>elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure</strong> (&gt;25 mm Hg).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Increased portal venous resistance (portal hypertension) is seen in the setting of hepatic cirrhosis or extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis.&nbsp; Chronic liver disease is associated with stigmata such as palmar erythema, spider angiomata, caput medusae, and gynecomastia.&nbsp; Complications of cirrhosis with portal hypertension include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and variceal bleeding.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is an estimation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and is elevated in patients with left ventricular systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.&nbsp; Patients with elevated PCWP typically have signs of pulmonary edema on lung auscultation.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Hypoalbuminemia may occur due to decreased hepatic synthesis (cirrhosis) or increased urinary or gastrointestinal protein loss (ie, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy).&nbsp; Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with <strong>periorbital</strong> and pedal edema that may progress to <strong>generalized edema (anasarca)</strong>, ascites, and pleural effusions.&nbsp; Patients can also develop severe intravascular hypovolemia due to over-diuresis and fluid movement into the interstitial spaces.&nbsp; This patient does not have anasarca or facial edema; he also does not have stigmata of chronic liver disease or diarrhea (to suggest enteropathy).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cor pulmonale is impaired function of the right ventricle due to <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong> that usually occurs due to chronic lung disease.&nbsp; Signs of right ventricular failure include:</p><ul><li>Elevated jugular venous pressure</li><li>Right ventricular 3rd heart sound</li><li>Tricuspid regurgitation murmur</li><li>Hepatomegaly with pulsatile liver</li><li>Lower-extremity edema, ascites, and/or pleural effusions</li></ul><p>Echocardiogram will show signs of increased right heart pressures, and right heart catheterization will show pulmonary systolic pressure &gt;25 mm Hg.</p>",

HCM is an autosomal dominant inherited condition involving mutations in genes that encode proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.&nbsp; The <strong>phenotypic manifestations</strong> typically begin during adolescence and include the following:</p><ul><li>Asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, usually primarily affecting the interventricular septum</li><li>Myocardial disarray</li><li>Coronary microvascular dysfunction with a poorly developed capillary network</li></ul><p>Depending on the degree of interventricular septal hypertrophy, many patients with HCM have dynamic LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction that can be recognized by a crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the left sternal border.&nbsp; The LVOT obstruction commonly causes exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, lightheadedness).&nbsp; However, not all patients have significant LVOT obstruction and the associated murmur.&nbsp; Such patients <strong>may be asymptomatic</strong> or may still have exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, angina) caused by myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch.&nbsp; These patients may also still be at increased risk for ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Athlete&#39;s heart consists of physiologic adaptations that occur in response to intense <a href=\"38697\">exercise training</a>.&nbsp; Left ventricular hypertrophy is typically present, but impaired diastolic filling and left atrial enlargement are not expected and suggest HCM.&nbsp; Significant depolarization or repolarization abnormalities on ECG are also not expected (sinus bradycardia, increased QRS voltage, and J point elevation may be seen).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Brugada syndrome follows autosomal dominant inheritance and usually involves mutations affecting cardiac sodium channels.&nbsp; Affected patients have ECG abnormalities (eg, ST elevation in leads V<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> and V<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) and are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (due to ventricular arrhythmia), but no structural cardiac abnormalities are typically present.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Prolonged, uncontrolled hypertension (usually for &#8805;10 years) is the most common cause of LV hypertrophy.&nbsp; This concentric LV hypertrophy commonly leads to impaired diastolic function and left atrial enlargement, but it is highly unlikely in this adolescent patient who currently has normal blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may not have significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction to cause a murmur.&nbsp; Findings that differentiate HCM from athlete&#39;s heart, another potential cause of left ventricular hypertrophy in young patients, include depolarization or repolarization abnormalities on ECG and evidence of diastolic dysfunction or left atrial enlargement on echocardiography.</p>",

Many patients with HCM have asymmetric <a href=\"19605\">hypertrophy of the interventricular septum</a>, which can cause <strong>dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction</strong> that leads to exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, lightheadedness [presyncope]).&nbsp; Characteristic physical examination findings include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur</strong> that increases in intensity with decreased LV blood volume (and vice versa)</p></li><li><p><strong>Audible S4</strong> caused by impaired diastolic function of the thickened left ventricle</p></li><li><p><strong>Brisk carotid pulses</strong> resulting from rapid and unobstructed blood ejection during early systole, followed by collapse of the LVOT by mid-to-late systole</p></li></ul><p>Several of these findings are similar to those of aortic stenosis (AS), a common complication of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.&nbsp; With both AS and HCM, an S4 can be seen, and the crescendo-decrescendo murmur decreases in intensity with increased afterload (in HCM this is due to increased LV blood volume; in AS it is due to decreased pressure gradient across the valve).&nbsp; However, HCM and AS can be differentiated by the following physical examination features:</p><ul><li><p>Murmur characteristics: Variation in murmur intensity with decreased LV preload (decreased with&nbsp;AS vs increased with HCM) and location of optimal auscultation (right upper sternal border for AS vs left sternal border for HCM)</p></li><li><p>Ejection click: usually present with AS vs not seen with HCM</p></li><li><p>Carotid and peripheral pulses: soft and delayed in AS (due to obstruction of LVOT blood flow throughout systole) vs brisk and rapid in HCM</p></li></ul><p>Age is also helpful as HCM usually presents in adolescents and young adults whereas AS is rare in patients age &lt;40.&nbsp; In this patient, age, murmur location, and peripheral pulse characteristics (rapid upstroke) all make HCM more likely than AS.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; LV systolic failure (ie, decreased contractility) can cause dyspnea and fatigue (and rarely syncope or presyncope), and may occur following viral infection (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy).&nbsp; A murmur of secondary mitral regurgitation may be present but is holosystolic and best heard at the cardiac apex.&nbsp; Symptomatic patients usually have evidence of volume overload with pulmonary edema and jugular venous distension.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Intracardiac right-to-left shunting can occur through either an atrial or ventricular septal defect and leads to Eisenmenger syndrome.&nbsp; Dyspnea is common, and syncope or presyncope can occur, but marked hypoxemia (eg, oxygen saturation &lt;88%) is expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary outflow tract obstruction (eg, pulmonic stenosis) can cause dyspnea and syncope or presyncope.&nbsp; It is recognized by a crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border; no effect on the pulse upstroke in the systemic circulation is expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Characteristic physical examination findings in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include a crescendo-decrescendo murmur that increases in intensity with decreased left ventricular blood volume (and vice versa), an audible S4, and brisk carotid pulses.</p>",

Several features suggest that, in this case, the most likely diagnosis is&nbsp;<strong>cardiac amyloidosis</strong>.&nbsp; Amyloidosis (characterized by tissue infiltration with insoluble protein fibrils) that&nbsp;involves the heart is usually caused by amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) or <strong>amyloid light chain</strong> (AL).&nbsp; ATTR occurs in both hereditary and age-related forms and commonly affects the nervous system (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome) in addition to the heart.&nbsp; AL can affect the heart and many other organ systems (eg, <strong>kidneys</strong>,&nbsp;liver, skin,&nbsp;<strong>gastrointestinal tract</strong>, peripheral nerves) and is most likely in this patient with&nbsp;<strong>proteinuria</strong>&nbsp;and apparent early satiety (eg, abdominal fullness, decreased appetite)</p><p>Myocardial infiltration by amyloid proteins typically creates <strong>stiff and thickened ventricular walls</strong> manifesting as <strong>restrictive cardiomyopathy</strong>.&nbsp; Echocardiographic evidence of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, especially in the absence of hypertension, can be a helpful clue.&nbsp; Diastolic filling of the left ventricle is impaired, causing elevated hydrostatic pressure to back up and lead to <strong>biatrial enlargement</strong>, pulmonary edema, and signs of <strong>right-sided heart failure</strong> (eg, jugular venous distension [JVD]; ascites causing abdominal distension with flank dullness;&nbsp;lower extremity edema).&nbsp; Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is typically preserved or may be increased (ie, <strong>heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</strong>).&nbsp; A small pericardial effusion is common, possibly resulting from an inflammatory response to infiltrating amyloid.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Chronic interstitial nephritis can be caused by medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), infection (eg, HIV, syphilis), and autoimmune disease (eg, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome).&nbsp; It often causes proteinuria but would not explain this patient&#39;s ventricular wall thickening.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) typically involves asymmetric thickening of the interventricular septum with reduced LV cavity size, and commonly demonstrates normal or increased LV ejection fraction.&nbsp; Amyloidosis is more likely in this patient given the absence of the characteristic HCM systolic murmur and the presence of proteinuria and&nbsp;early satiety.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Inferior vena cava thrombosis can lead to lower extremity edema and ascites, but JVD and evidence of pulmonary edema are not expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Ischemic heart disease is a common cause of heart failure, but it typically leads to LV systolic dysfunction and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Nephrotic range proteinuria (ie, &gt;3.5 g/24 hr) can result in protein malnutrition.&nbsp; Edema is common, but it tends to cause loss of cardiac muscle mass rather than thickening of the myocardium.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Thiamine deficiency can lead to high-output heart failure, which demonstrates ventricular cavity enlargement on echocardiography.&nbsp; Thickened ventricular walls are not expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cardiac amyloidosis classically manifests as restrictive cardiomyopathy and should be a diagnostic consideration in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.&nbsp; Amyloid light chain commonly demonstrates prominent organ system involvement outside the heart (eg, nephropathy, bruising).</p>",

Vasovagal syncope typically involves a <strong>brief loss of consciousness</strong> (LOC) (eg, 1-2 min) preceded by a <strong>trigger</strong> (eg, emotional stress while rushing for the bus) and a <strong>vagal prodrome</strong> (eg, diaphoresis, warmth).&nbsp; Classic vasovagal syncope is usually diagnosed based on history alone, but <strong>other causes of syncope</strong> that are either more serious or require intervention <strong>must be excluded</strong>.</p><p><strong>Cardiac syncope</strong> must be considered because it results from underlying cardiac disease that may cause sudden cardiac death.&nbsp; It typically occurs without warning in patients with structural heart disease (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or conduction disturbances (eg, long QT syndrome) and is usually suggested by systolic murmur or ECG abnormalities.&nbsp; The presence of a murmur should prompt further investigation with echocardiography, and ECG abnormalities should prompt further conduction system workup (eg, 24-hr Holter monitoring).&nbsp; However, patients (such as this one) with a <strong>clinical history</strong> consistent with vasovagal syncope and no findings to suggest cardiac syncope require no further cardiac workup <strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Orthostatic syncope</strong> should be considered because appropriate intervention (eg, fluid resuscitation, medication discontinuation) may be indicated.&nbsp; This patient is at increased risk of orthostatic syncope due to a <a href=\"31889\">medication</a> that impairs peripheral vasoconstriction (ie, amlodipine); however, syncope occurred while sitting, and vital signs are not consistent with <a href=\"1222\">orthostatic hypotension</a>.</p><p>Given this patient&#39;s classic presentation for vasovagal syncope and low likelihood of cardiac or orthostatic syncope, she requires <strong>no further testing or intervention</strong> at this time.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; CT scan of the head may be indicated for LOC associated with ongoing neurologic symptoms (eg, headache) or findings (eg, focal deficits); it is not indicated in classic vasovagal syncope.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Seizure activity (diagnosed on electroencephalography) can cause a sudden LOC; however, other suggestive features (eg, jerking movements of the limbs, tongue laceration, postictal period) are typically present.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Tilt-table testing can help distinguish between orthostatic and vasovagal syncope if the etiology is unclear and episodes recur.&nbsp; It is not indicated after a single episode classic for vasovagal syncope.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Classic vasovagal syncope involves a brief loss of consciousness preceded by a trigger (eg, emotional distress) and a vagal prodrome (eg, diaphoresis, warmth).&nbsp; No further workup or intervention is indicated when there are no physical examination or ECG findings to suggest other etiologies (eg, cardiac, orthostatic).</p>",
