Symptoms primarily arise from noradrenergic hyperactivity in the locus caeruleus, a pontine nucleus involved in wakefulness, breathing, and autonomic function.&nbsp; When opioids are stopped after chronic use, the loss of their usual inhibitory effect leads to a sudden increase in norepinephrine.&nbsp; This results in <a href=\"3312\">withdrawal symptoms</a>, which commonly include sleep disturbances, nausea/<strong>vomiting, abdominal pain</strong> (eg, cramping), <strong>diarrhea</strong>, and arthralgia/<strong>myalgia</strong>.</p><p>On examination, patients may be restless and irritable.&nbsp; <strong>Vital signs</strong> are <strong>often normal</strong> (as in this patient).&nbsp; Mild elevations in heart rate and blood pressure can also occur in opioid dependence but, when present, are less severe than in other withdrawal states (eg, alcohol, benzodiazepine) that are associated with profound autonomic instability.&nbsp; Diaphoresis, pupillary dilation (mydriasis), piloerection, and yawning may also be evident.&nbsp; Hyperthermia and altered mental status (eg, confusion, psychosis) do not typically occur; the presence of either suggests an alternate diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cholinergic poisoning is caused by substances (eg, organophosphates) that increase acetylcholine accumulation at cholinergic receptors (both muscarinic and nicotinic).&nbsp; <a href=\"13991\">Symptoms</a> can include sweating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; however, bradycardia (vs normal heart rate) and salivation (vs dry mucous membranes) would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Amphetamine intoxication can present with vomiting, difficulty sleeping, diaphoresis, and dry mucous membranes.&nbsp; However, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia are frequently present due to indirect adrenergic stimulation.&nbsp; Confusion and paranoia are also common.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and D)</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal can present with vomiting and sleep disturbances.&nbsp; However, patients also typically have autonomic hyperactivity manifested by significant elevations in pulse, blood pressure, and temperature (vs normal vital signs).&nbsp; Altered mental status (eg, agitation, delirium, psychosis) and seizures are also often present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sleep disturbances, and myalgia.&nbsp; In contrast to other withdrawal states (eg, alcohol, benzodiazepine) with similar symptoms, in opioid dependence, heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature are often normal and mental status remains unchanged.</p>",

In contrast, in separation anxiety disorder, physical symptoms (eg, stomachaches, hyperventilation, headaches) occur only when separation is anticipated.&nbsp; Unlike someone with somatic symptom disorder, this patient does not exhibit excessive preoccupation with her symptoms.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Separation anxiety disorder is most commonly seen in infants and toddlers but can occur at any age and is often associated with transition or change.&nbsp; It is characterized by a marked fear of separation from a loved one and may present as school or work absences.</p>",
