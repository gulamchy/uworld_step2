The etiology is unclear but may be due to innate immune response to skin bacteria penetrating hair follicles.</p><p>ETN typically presents by age <strong>3 days</strong> in full-term neonates.&nbsp; The rash usually begins as small, <strong>poorly demarcated</strong> erythematous <strong>macules</strong> and <strong>papules</strong> that classically involve the <strong>trunk</strong> and <strong>proximal extremities</strong> but may occur anywhere except the palms and soles (where no hair follicles are present).&nbsp; Lesions often evolve into small, firm <strong>pustules</strong> on <strong>erythematous bases</strong>.&nbsp; The rash is asymptomatic, and infants are otherwise well-appearing.&nbsp; Features that should raise suspicion of an alternate diagnosis include involvement of the palms and soles, lesions with crusting or a vesicular appearance, and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, irritability).</p><p>ETN is a <strong>clinical diagnosis</strong> and requires no treatment.&nbsp; Atypical cases may rarely require evaluation of the pustule contents, which are sterile with an eosinophilic infiltration.&nbsp; The rash may wax and wane in severity, but <strong>reassurance</strong> should be provided because it <strong>resolves spontaneously in a week</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Congenital syphilis, which is treated with intravenous penicillin, can present with a maculopapular rash distributed over the torso and extremities.&nbsp; However, the rash typically lacks pustules, involves the soles, and is accompanied by rhinitis (snuffles), hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, features not seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous valacyclovir is used to treat neonatal herpes, which presents as clustered vesicles on <a href=\"46203\">erythematous bases</a>, findings not seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Low-potency topical corticosteroids can be considered for severe miliaria rubra (heat rash), which presents as a fine, <a href=\"46204\">erythematous papular rash</a>.&nbsp; Scattered pustules, as described in this patient, would not be present.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Topical mupirocin treats staphylococcal pustulosis, which presents in neonates as localized erythematous pustules, vesicles, or bullous lesions that rupture to form erosions and honey-colored crusts.&nbsp; These features are absent in this patient.&nbsp; Moreover, the classic distribution involves the diaper area or a prior wound (eg, circumcision site).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a benign neonatal rash that presents within the first 3 days of life as erythematous macules, papules, or pustules on the trunk and proximal extremities, sparing the palms and soles.&nbsp; Patients are otherwise asymptomatic, no treatment is required, and the rash self-resolves within a week.</p>",
