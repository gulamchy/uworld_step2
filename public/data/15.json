Although it typically follows an increased SSRI (eg, <strong>fluoxetine</strong>) dosage, serotonin toxicity can also be precipitated by concomitant use of another serotonergic agent.&nbsp; This patient recently began taking the antitussive <strong>dextromethorphan</strong>, which primarily activates sigma opioid receptors to inhibit cough but also has serotonergic activity at the 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTA) 2 receptors.</p><p>Management often includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Discontinuation</strong> of all <strong>serotonergic medications</strong></p></li><li><p>Management of severe hypertension with <strong>short-acting antihypertensives</strong> (eg, esmolol)</p></li><li><p>Intravenous hydration, and evaporative and convective <strong>cooling</strong> (eg, fanning, water mist).&nbsp;

Serotonin toxicity can have a relatively rapid onset and progression; some patients require intubation and sedation (eg, for severe hyperthermia).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, is used to treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).&nbsp; Although NMS can also present with hyperthermia and autonomic dysregulation, severe muscle rigidity is typically a prominent feature; myoclonus and hyperreflexia are less common.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Haloperidol, an antipsychotic that treats psychosis and agitation, should not be used in serotonin toxicity because its anticholinergic properties prevent the dissipation of body heat, exacerbating hyperthermia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although pneumonia (treated with levofloxacin) can present with fever and altered mental status after upper respiratory tract symptoms, this patient&#39;s normal oxygen saturation and clear lungs make pneumonia less likely.&nbsp; Also, it would be unusual for pneumonia to develop suddenly after 3 weeks of dry cough, and dilated pupils and neuromuscular excitability would not be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Physostigmine is sometimes used to treat anticholinergic toxicity, which can cause delirium, mydriasis, hyperthermia, and hypertension.&nbsp; However, hyperreflexia and clonus would be unexpected, and this patient&#39;s combination of serotonergic medications makes serotonin toxicity more likely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Serotonin toxicity is characterized by mental status changes, autonomic dysregulation, and neuromuscular excitability.&nbsp; Management includes discontinuation of serotonergic medications, hydration, cooling, and blood pressure control.&nbsp; Benzodiazepines are used to decrease agitation and muscle contractions.&nbsp; Cyproheptadine is used to decrease central serotonergic activity.</p>",
