Interventions are geared to the patient&#39;s stage of <strong>readiness to change</strong>.&nbsp; Elements include a nonjudgmental stance focusing on the patient&#39;s intrinsic motivation to change, acknowledging ambivalence and resistance to change, and supporting the patient&#39;s autonomy and efforts to take responsibility.</p><p>This patient has recurrent alcoholic pancreatitis and has failed previous attempts at inpatient alcohol rehabilitation, but he is willing to consider outpatient therapy (<strong>contemplation stage</strong>).&nbsp; Appropriate steps at this point would be to explain how referral for outpatient treatment might work, discuss the <strong>pros and cons</strong> of outpatient treatment compared to inpatient treatment, and assess the patient&#39;s <strong>conviction</strong> (understanding of the importance of change) and <strong>confidence</strong> (self-perceived ability to change).&nbsp; The physician should allow the patient time to consider all options and should also arrange follow-up for planning the next steps in treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>&nbsp; A basic discussion of disease processes and complications can provide motivation for change and is most appropriate for a patient in the precontemplation stage.&nbsp; However, this patient acknowledges that change is needed and is willing to consider at least some treatment options.&nbsp; Continued emphasis on consequences from lack of change is likely only to promote anxiety and frustration.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; These statements do not acknowledge patient autonomy.&nbsp; Even if the physician is certain that inpatient treatment would benefit the patient, a better understanding of the patient&#39;s perspective is needed before pushing him to do what he does not want.&nbsp; Making arrangements to schedule an appointment with a treatment program before the patient is agreeable may diminish his commitment to treatment.&nbsp; Such actions are more appropriate for a patient in a preparation stage who can collaborate with the physician and take some responsibility for treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; It is important to convey to all patients, in all stages of change, that their physician is committed to their benefit and is willing to help.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s willingness to consider treatment options shows that he takes his condition seriously, and this statement would likely be seen as condescending.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Contemplation is a stage of behavior change in which a patient is willing to consider changes to maladaptive behaviors but has not yet decided to pursue specific action.&nbsp; Patients considering behavioral change should be assessed for conviction (understanding importance of change) and confidence (self-perceived ability to change).</p>",

Malpractice claims review suggests most diagnostic errors involve <strong>cognitive biases</strong>, describing <strong>unconscious</strong> mental heuristics, or shortcuts (eg, pattern recognition), that incorrectly influence clinical reasoning, rather than inadequate knowledge.&nbsp; Cognitive biases lead to an <strong>incomplete</strong> differential diagnosis and failure to consider alternate diagnoses.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><ul><li><strong>availability bias</strong>, in which over-reliance on previous experiences (eg, a commonly seen case; a rarer but memorable, high-stakes case) influences diagnosis <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>framing bias</strong>, in which previous documentation or patient context (eg, patient demographics, descriptions of patient or past diagnoses in the medical record) influences diagnosis.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>confirmation bias</strong>, in which patient symptoms are incorrectly interpreted to fit a presumed diagnosis (eg, discounting inconsistent aspects of presentation, over-emphasizing pertinent positives).</li></ul><p>Clinicians are often unaware of the unconscious influences directing their clinical reasoning.&nbsp; <strong>Metacognition</strong>, the process of <strong>understanding</strong> and self-monitoring potentially flawed <strong>cognitive patterns</strong> and biases, has been associated with reduced judgment errors.&nbsp; Metacognition can be promoted through morbidity and mortality conferences and practicing diagnostic time-out (ie, critical reflection on the diagnostic thought process), particularly when caring for a complex patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cognitive biases involve intuitive, fast thinking (eg, mental shortcuts) formed from prior experiences.&nbsp; Preventing bias requires consciously applying analytical, slower thinking (eg, critically considering alternate diagnoses).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although careful chart review is important in promoting patient safety, prioritizing diagnoses made by past providers is likely to increase anchoring or framing biases.&nbsp; Diagnostic errors are more effectively reduced by reflecting on potential cognitive biases influencing diagnostic workup and independently considering a complex patient&#39;s presentation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Clinical decision support systems prompt clinicians to consider certain actions based on patient data (eg, warning of drug-drug interaction).&nbsp; However, such systems do not directly address clinical reasoning and are unlikely to reduce diagnostic error if clinicians lack understanding of how their unconscious biases can potentially undermine clinical judgment.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Diagnostic errors commonly result from cognitive bias, unconscious mental heuristics (shortcuts) distorting clinical judgment.&nbsp; Cognitive bias and associated diagnostic errors can be reduced by applying metacognition (ie, understanding and reflecting on one&#39;s own thought patterns and biases).</p>",

The processes of selecting among <strong>look-alike</strong> (ie, similarly appearing) vials and manually calculating and preparing doses are subject to <strong>human error</strong> (eg, <strong>misreading</strong> vial labels).&nbsp; This anesthesiologist accidentally selected a low-concentration vial (10 units/mL, typically used for flushing catheters), resulting in inadequate anticoagulation and increased patient risk for thromboembolic stroke (a complication of prolonged carotid artery clamping).</p><p><strong>Human factors engineering (HFE)</strong> reduces error by <strong>designing systems and environments</strong> that are responsive to human strengths and limitations.&nbsp; The most effective HFE strategies <strong>decrease reliance on human effort</strong> and awareness, which are potentially compromised in distraction-prone settings.&nbsp; An example is strategic <strong>design</strong> of the <strong>environment</strong> and physical layout.&nbsp; Since the close proximity of look-alike, low- and high-concentration heparin vials increases error risk, stocking these vials in separate locations (eg, different drawers) prevents inadvertent confusion.</p><p>Other relevant HFE strategies include standardization (eg, stocking carts with uniform, prefilled heparin syringes, which simplifies administration by eliminating need to manually prepare each dose) and visual cues (eg, using distinct colors on vial labels to facilitate quick visual differentiation among concentrations).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Device automation, which substitutes human effort with computerized processes to reduce error-inducing variability, is best suited to constant, predictable processes (eg, continuous drug infusion via smart pump, routine vital signs monitoring).&nbsp; In contrast, the dynamic bolus administration in this scenario is less amenable to automation; human involvement is necessary to critically analyze and rapidly respond to laboratory data (eg, activated PTT).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Heparin dosing is vulnerable to mathematical error due to multiple available concentrations and dosing protocols (eg, units/hr, mL/hr).&nbsp; This anesthesiologist&#39;s calculations were correct for the intended vial (ie, 5 mL &times; 1,000 units/mL = 5,000 units).</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Errors related to poor team communication and low psychological safety (ie, comfort in expressing safety-related concerns) can result from excessive team hierarchy or intimidation.&nbsp; Suboptimal workflow and environment precipitated this human error, not communication breakdown or fear.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Misreading look-alike drug vials is a leading cause of medication error in operative settings.&nbsp; Human factors engineering strategies can prevent such errors by designing systems that decrease human effort and facilitate correct action.&nbsp; Examples include environmental design changes separating look-alike medications, standardizing and simplifying processes, and using visual cues.</p>",

These biases can result from overdependence on <strong>heuristics</strong> (ie, mental shortcuts), which are often used to maximize diagnostic efficiency and productivity in busy, complex settings (eg, emergency department).&nbsp; Cognitive bias prevents thorough critical reasoning and workup, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment (up to 80,000 preventable hospital deaths per year in the United States).</p><p>The underdiagnosis of MI most likely reflects <strong>anchoring bias</strong> (also known as premature closure), occurring when <strong>initial impressions</strong> prematurely influence the diagnosis and prevent careful consideration of other possibilities.&nbsp; Anchoring bias can occur when presentations are more subtle (eg, atypical presentations of MI).&nbsp; In this case, initial &#x22;anchoring&#x22; to symptoms of mental stress prematurely influenced clinicians toward a noncardiac diagnosis (eg, gastroesophageal reflux), precluding proper consideration of MI as a cause of episodic chest pressure.</p><p>Anchoring bias can be minimized by enhancing clinician awareness (eg, morbidity and mortality review), providing training (eg, simulated cases illustrating biased thinking), and optimizing organizational and workplace factors (eg, limiting distractions).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Availability bias (or recency effect) occurs when clinicians&#39; thinking is influenced by recently or frequently seen cases (ie, diagnosing influenza when a patient with fever and dyspnea actually has a pulmonary embolism).&nbsp; Gastroesophageal reflux and MI are both commonly seen in emergency departments; therefore, availability bias is less likely to explain underdiagnosis of MI.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Knowledge deficiency is less likely because presentations of MI&mdash;including atypical presentations seen in women&mdash;are well known in the emergency department setting.&nbsp; Rather, presumptive anchoring to the symptom of mental stress represents a more likely cause of the clinicians&#39; failure to properly consider MI as the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Latent errors are system-level factors (eg, inefficient protocols) that cause adverse events.&nbsp; This case describes a series of active errors (ie, clinician misjudgment) caused by cognitive bias, not a system-level error.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Anchoring bias occurs when a diagnosis is prematurely swayed by immediate impressions (ie, an anchor).&nbsp; This bias can preclude thoroughly evaluating a differential diagnosis.&nbsp; An example of anchoring bias is prematurely assigning a non-cardiac diagnosis to chest pain associated with mental stress.</p>",
