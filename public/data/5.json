            "explanationText": "<p>This patient&#39;s presentation suggests <strong>gallstone pancreatitis</strong> complicated by acute cholangitis.&nbsp; Gallstone pancreatitis develops when a gallstone passes through the biliary tree and obstructs the ampulla or flow from the pancreatic duct, allowing bile to reflux into the pancreas.&nbsp; In addition to the classic manifestations of pancreatitis (eg, <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, nausea/vomiting, <strong>elevated serum lipase</strong> or amylase), patients with obstruction of the ampulla may also demonstrate cholestatic liver function studies (eg, elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases).</p><p>If the stone remains in the biliary tract, the resultant bile stasis can allow bacteria to ascend from the duodenum, leading to <strong>acute cholangitis</strong>.&nbsp; In addition to cholestatic liver function studies (due to stasis and obstruction), the presence of Charcot triad (<strong>right upper quadrant pain</strong>, jaundice, <strong>fevers</strong>) suggests the diagnosis, and <strong>altered mental status</strong> and hypotension (ie, Reynolds pentad) indicate particularly severe disease.&nbsp; <strong>Common bile duct dilation</strong> (as seen in this patient) or choledocholithiasis on a right upper quadrant ultrasound further support the diagnosis.</p><p>Management includes aggressive intravenous hydration and antibiotics.&nbsp; <strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</strong> (ERCP) is indicated to relieve the biliary obstruction, during which a sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and/or biliary stent placement can be performed.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although a CT scan can help diagnose pancreatitis, the combination of acute abdominal pain and elevated serum lipase is sufficient for diagnosis.&nbsp; In addition, a CT scan is less sensitive than an ultrasound for detecting changes associated with cholangitis (eg, common bile duct dilation) and may miss gallstones, which are frequently radiolucent.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; A HIDA scan is used to diagnose cholecystitis in patients with equivocal ultrasound findings; however, in addition to fevers and right upper quadrant pain, cholecystitis results in gallbladder wall thickening and edema visible on ultrasound, whereas biliary dilation suggests cholangitis.&nbsp; An elective cholecystectomy to prevent further complications of gallstone disease should be deferred until after the current complications have resolved.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The presence of cholangitis requires ERCP to relieve the biliary obstruction; failure to remove the obstructive gallstone may result in septic shock and death.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Acute cholangitis should be suspected in a patient with gallstone pancreatitis who also has fevers, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, altered mental status, and hypotension.&nbsp; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is required to relieve the biliary obstruction and prevent serious infectious complications.</p>",
