Radiculopathies typically occur due to compression of the nerve root due to disk herniation (evidenced by acute symptom onset) or progressive spinal spondylosis (evidenced by subacute or progressive symptom onset).&nbsp; Cervical radiculopathy occurs most commonly in middle-aged men and may develop after repetitive exercise (eg, golf).</p><p>Manifestations depend on the involved nerve root but typically include <strong>pain in the neck and upper extremity</strong> associated with <strong>sensory and motor deficits</strong> and <strong>diminished reflexes</strong>.&nbsp; Shoulder abduction reduces tension on the impinged nerve root, and improvement of radicular symptoms when the hand is placed on the top of the head (ie, <strong>shoulder abduction relief test</strong>) is both diagnostic and therapeutic for short-term pain relief.</p><p>Patients with mild deficits and low concern for malignancy or infection usually experience gradual resolution and may be <strong>managed conservatively</strong> (eg, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy) without neuroimaging.&nbsp;

Shoulder joint capsulitis (ie, frozen shoulder) is characterized by gradual-onset shoulder stiffness with a reduction in both passive and active range of motion in multiple planes.&nbsp; Reflexes are unaffected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Thoracic outlet syndrome results from brachial plexus compression as it passes through the thoracic outlet; patients develop upper extremity weakness and paresthesia, often with swelling and exertional arm pain (due to involvement of the subclavian vessels).&nbsp;
