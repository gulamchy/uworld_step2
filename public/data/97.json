            "explanationText": "<p>This patient&#39;s symptoms are concerning for a <a href=\"22257\">groin hernia</a>, which often presents with <strong>intermittent groin swelling</strong> and <strong>pain</strong> (or discomfort) aggravated by activities that increase intraabdominal pressure (eg, heavy lifting, prolonged standing).&nbsp; Pain may occur from constriction of the hernia contents at the neck of the hernia sac or from stretching of the ilioinguinal nerve; referred pain to the scrotum or inner thigh is common.</p><p>Because a <a href=\"68757\">reducible hernia</a> may not be evident on initial inspection/palpation of the groin and scrotum, the groin should also be examined while the patient performs a <strong>Valsalva maneuver</strong> (forced expiration against a closed glottis).&nbsp; By <strong>increasing intraabdominal pressure</strong>, this maneuver pushes hernia contents through the abdominal wall defect, making them <strong>easier to visualize or palpate</strong>.&nbsp; Typically, the maneuver is performed with the patient standing while the examiner, to feel for an impulse or bulge, invaginates the scrotal skin and places a finger through the superficial inguinal ring into the inguinal canal.&nbsp; A thorough physical examination is typically sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of inguinal hernia (particularly in men).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Eliciting the cremasteric reflex and performing scrotal Doppler ultrasonography can help diagnose testicular torsion.&nbsp; In affected patients, the cremasteric reflex is typically absent, and testicular blood flow is decreased or absent on ultrasound examination.&nbsp; However, testicular torsion typically causes sudden, severe, scrotal pain and swelling, findings that are not consistent with this patient&#39;s presentation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"2767\">Hydroceles</a> can be diagnosed with transillumination of the scrotum (light will pass through a hydrocele but not a solid mass).&nbsp; However, hydroceles typically cause diffuse scrotal swelling, which is not present in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1461\">Varicoceles</a> classically engorge with standing and decompress with lying down.&nbsp; Thus, they may be more readily detected when the spermatic veins are palpated with the patient standing.&nbsp; In contrast to this patient, those with varicoceles typically do not have pain; a painless scrotal mass or decreased fertility is a more common presentation.&nbsp; In addition, most varicoceles are left sided.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Groin hernias can cause referred pain to the scrotum along with groin swelling exacerbated by increased abdominal pressure (eg, prolonged standing, straining).&nbsp; Examining the groin during Valsalva maneuver increases the likelihood of hernia detection, especially for reducible hernias that may not be visible on initial groin inspection/palpation.</p>",
