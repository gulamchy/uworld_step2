There is no evidence for underlying connective tissue disease (ie, normal skin and joint examinations) or history of relevant exposure (eg, asbestos, pneumotoxic drugs).&nbsp; This presentation is most consistent with <strong>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</strong> (IPF), diagnosed when UIP is present on HRCT and secondary causes of UIP (eg, autoimmune disease, exposures) have been excluded.&nbsp; IPF can be a devastating diagnosis; average survival is 2-3 years.</p><p>Central to IPF pathogenesis is alveolar epithelial injury that is inappropriately repaired by fibrosis (scarring).&nbsp; <strong>Antifibrotic therapy</strong> has revolutionized IPF treatment.&nbsp; These small-molecule inhibitors <strong>block profibrotic growth factor signaling</strong> (eg, transforming growth factor &#946;), reducing fibroblast proliferation and collagen production.&nbsp; They are approved for IPF patients with diminished lung function, such as reduced forced vital capacity (FVC).&nbsp; Antifibrotic drugs <strong>slow the rate of FVC decline</strong> but cannot restore lost lung function.&nbsp; Candidates for treatment should be identified early and monitored closely for progression.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Because low levels of lung inflammation are common in IPF, pharmacologic immunosuppression was once regarded as a promising treatment strategy.&nbsp; However, inflammatory responses are likely reactive to the primary epithelial injury and fibrosis.&nbsp; Clinical trials of immunosuppression (eg, prednisone [corticosteroid], azathioprine [noncorticosteroid]) demonstrated harm, including increased mortality.&nbsp; If lung fibrosis is suspected to be driven by a systemic autoimmune disease (eg, scleroderma-associated UIP), immunosuppression is considered on an individual basis.&nbsp; Forms of ILD that tend to be corticosteroid-responsive include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (eg, groundglass/consolidative opacities on HRCT, alveolar granulation tissue on histopathology).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Exposure to organic antigens can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).&nbsp; Acute HP presents with short-lived episodes following exposure.&nbsp; Chronic HP can develop with continued exposure causing fibrotic evolution; it can be seen in wind instrument (eg, bagpipe, rather than trumpet) players due to mold overgrowth.&nbsp; However, the timeline of this patient&#39;s symptoms (8 months) does not correspond to exposure (started lessons 3 months ago), and the radiographic pattern (ie, lower lobe honeycombing, peripheral reticular markings) revealed by HRCT scanning is specific for UIP rather than HP.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Although IPF survival is limited, antifibrotic therapy should be considered, especially in patients with good functional status who may also be eligible for lung transplantation.&nbsp; Hospice care may become appropriate when life expectancy is &#8804;6 months.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disorder of epithelial injury that has been pathologically repaired by fibrotic responses.&nbsp; Antifibrotic drugs inhibit fibroblasts to slow the rate of lung function decline and are first-line therapy.</p>",

On <strong>pulmonary function testing</strong>, IPF is associated with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Restrictive profile</strong>:&nbsp; Typically decreased total lung capacity (TLC) and normal FEV1/FVC ratio</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced diffusion capacity</strong>&nbsp;for carbon monoxide (DLCO):&nbsp; Likely due to decreased pulmonary capillary erythrocyte volume and alveolar-capillary surface area</p></li></ul><p>IPF commonly presents at age 50-70; most patients have a history of smoking.&nbsp; In addition to fine bibasilar crackles, patients in advanced disease may develop end-inspiratory squeaks, digital clubbing, and an abnormal S2 (eg, loud P2; fixed, split S2) due to pulmonary hypertension.</p><p>Evaluation should include a thorough history to identify evidence of autoimmune disease, use of associated medications (eg, amiodarone), <strong>occupational exposures</strong>, and therapeutic radiation.&nbsp; For example, this patient&#39;s long career in the <strong>navy</strong> places him at increased risk due to asbestos exposure.&nbsp; Chest x-ray typically demonstrates nonspecific reticular infiltrates, but chest CT findings such as peripheral or basilar reticular infiltrates and honeycombing are more helpful in establishing the diagnosis.&nbsp; If imaging is nondiagnostic or the clinical picture is atypical, a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; An increase in TLC with drops in both FEV1/FVC and DLCO is associated with emphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&nbsp; However, in the absence of a history of smoking, wheezing, or productive cough, this condition is less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; A reduction in the TLC without any changes to the FEV1/FVC ratio or DLCO is consistent with chest wall deformities due to diseases such as scoliosis or obesity.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with reductions in the DLCO without affecting either the TLC or the FEV1/FVC ratio.&nbsp; This patient does not have clear risk factors for isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension (eg, connective tissue disorders, liver disease) or examination findings that point to it (eg, abnormal S2, jugular venous distension).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary function testing in asthma is variable but can demonstrate either normal or increased TLC and DLCO with reductions in the FEV1/FVC ratio.&nbsp; Although asthma can be characterized by dyspnea and cough, these symptoms occur episodically as patients are exposed to inflammatory triggers.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s slow, progressive worsening is more typical of IPF.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by slowly progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and fine crackles and commonly occurs in patients age 50-70.&nbsp; It is associated with a restrictive profile and reduced diffusion capacity on pulmonary function testing.</p>",

Patients with a history of atopy (eg, asthma, eczema) are more likely to develop HP, and smoking decreases the risk of developing HP, possibly due to blunting of the pulmonary immunologic response.</p><p>HP can have <strong>variable presentation</strong> depending on the dose and chronicity of antigen exposure.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acute HP</strong> (present in this patient) likely results from relatively high-dose acute exposure and presents with abrupt-onset (eg, within 6 hr) symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, cough, dyspnea).&nbsp; Hypoxemia is common and crackles are often present on lung auscultation.&nbsp; Chest x-ray is normal in some cases but usually shows <a href=\"39603\">scattered micronodular interstitial opacities</a> representing <strong>patchy interstitial inflammation</strong>.&nbsp;
