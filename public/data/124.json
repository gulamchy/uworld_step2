Patients often report having to use a splinting technique (eg, insert a finger into the vagina to hold the herniated mass in pace) to void or defecate.&nbsp; In a patient with vaginal wall prolapse after hysterectomy, pelvic examination typically reveals a <strong>vaginal mass</strong> (ie, herniation of the bladder) that <strong>increases in size with the Valsalva</strong> maneuver.&nbsp; Examination also stages the extent of individual organ descent and guides management.</p><p>Treatment of pelvic organ prolapse includes weight loss, pelvic floor muscle exercises, and vaginal <a href=\"6261\">pessary</a> placement or surgical repair.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Intrinsic sphincter deficiency, a form of stress urinary incontinence, causes involuntary leakage and loss of urine with the Valsalva maneuver.&nbsp; Patients have no urinary retention or any difficulty initiating micturition.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Ovarian cancer metastasis typically presents as an abdominal (rather than vaginal) mass and may cause urinary symptoms (eg, frequency) due to mass effect of the tumor compressing the bladder.&nbsp; This diagnosis is unlikely in this patient due to lack of ascites.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Urethral diverticulum may present with dysuria and postvoid dribbling but not urinary retention or pelvic pressure.&nbsp; Pelvic examination typically reveals a tender anterior vaginal wall mass with expression of urine or pus.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Urge incontinence (eg, overactive bladder) presents with a sudden onset of urinary urgency and involuntary loss of urine.&nbsp; Urinary retention and difficulty initiating voiding are not features.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Urinary tract infection can present with the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying but typically also produces dysuria, hematuria, and an abnormal urinalysis, none of which is seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"4908\">Vesicovaginal fistula</a> is a complication of pelvic surgery characterized by a continuous involuntary loss of urine in the absence of other urinary symptoms (eg, incomplete emptying, difficulty initiating stream).&nbsp; Leakage of urine from the fistula opening is typically visualized on pelvic examination.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of pelvic organs through the vagina.&nbsp; It can present with pelvic pressure, urinary retention, incontinence, and obstructed voiding.&nbsp; Risk factors include multiparity, postmenopausal age, hysterectomy, and obesity.</p>",
