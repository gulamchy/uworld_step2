            "explanationText": "<p>This patient with <strong>chronic insomnia</strong> has developed behavioral maladaptions (eg, anxiety about sleep, sleeping later on weekends, lying awake in bed for long periods of time).&nbsp; <strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)</strong> is first-line treatment for patients with chronic insomnia to improve sleep behaviors; when implemented correctly, it can successfully resolve chronic insomnia without medications.</p><p>In CBT-I, patients are first instructed to keep a <strong>sleep diary</strong> (eg, bedtime, approximate time to fall asleep, timing and duration of nighttime awakenings, final wake time), enabling calculation of current <strong>sleep efficiency</strong> (ie, number of hours spent asleep / number of hours in bed).&nbsp; Then, targeted strategies are implemented to increase sleep efficiency to near 100%, increase sleep drive, and strengthen the association between being in bed and sleeping.&nbsp; Strategies may include:</p><ul><li><p>Establishing an optimal and <strong>consistent wake and sleep time</strong> across weekdays and weekends (ie, avoiding sleeping late)</p></li><li><p><strong>Limiting time spent in bed awake</strong>.&nbsp; Patients should use the bed only for sleep or sex (eg, instead of watching television) and physically leave the bed if they are awake in bed &gt;20 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improving sleep hygiene</strong> (eg, moderating caffeine intake, limiting alcohol use before bed, addressing sleep anxiety)</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Going to bed earlier typically worsens chronic insomnia because it reduces sleep efficiency (eg, increasing time spent awake in bed waiting to sleep).&nbsp; Typically, CBT-I initially involves paradoxically delaying bedtime (but keeping a set wake time) until sleep efficiency is 100%; gradually, bedtime is moved earlier until the patient achieves a sufficient quantity of sleep.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Sleep difficulties can result from major depressive disorder, which is often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline).&nbsp; However, this patient enjoys her job and has no evidence of low self-esteem or feeling hopeless.&nbsp; Her reduction in social activities is more likely connected to her underlying preoccupation about sleep, and CBT-I should be tried first.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and D)</strong>&nbsp; Benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medication zolpidem can be used for acute treatment of situational insomnia.&nbsp; However, long-term use is associated with adverse effects, including somnolence, dependence, and cognitive impairment.&nbsp; Therefore, CBT-I should be tried first.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>In patients with chronic insomnia, first-line treatment involves cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to improve sleep hygiene and sleep efficiency.&nbsp; Patients should first keep a sleep diary, which helps to identify opportunities to improve sleep efficiency (eg, limiting time in bed) and establish an optimal, consistent sleep and wake time.</p>",
