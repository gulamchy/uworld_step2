<strong>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy</strong>, which can occur in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus, is a common risk factor for VH because the abnormal, fragile blood vessels (ie, neovascularization) on the surface of the retina can spontaneously break and bleed into the vitreous.&nbsp; Intravitreal blood prevents light from reaching the retina, causing patients to experience sudden-onset hazy vision, sometimes with a red hue, or <strong>vision loss</strong>.&nbsp; Patients also may report seeing floaters or shadows (eg, due to floating blood clots).</p><p>Examination findings depend on the density of the hemorrhage and can range from visualization of intravitreal red blood cells or <strong>debris</strong> on slit-lamp examination to, when the hemorrhage is dense enough, a <strong>dark red glow</strong> and <strong>loss of fundal details</strong> on ophthalmoscopy.&nbsp; Management includes bed rest to reduce further bleeding and head of bed elevation to enhance inferior settling of the hemorrhage away from the visual axis.&nbsp; In addition, ophthalmologic intervention is often necessary to address the underlying cause of the hemorrhage (eg, photocoagulation for proliferative retinopathy).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with macular degeneration typically have painless blurring of central vision that is progressive (vs acute) and bilateral (vs unilateral).</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C) </strong> Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) can present with sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss.&nbsp; However, funduscopic examination demonstrates different findings: CRAO typically causes a pale retina with a <a href=\"1224\">cherry-red macula</a>, whereas CRVO typically causes dilated and tortuous veins, <a href=\"1214\">scattered and diffuse hemorrhages</a>, disc swelling, and/or cotton-wool spots.</p><p><strong>(Choice D) </strong> Patients with <a href=\"1212\">retinal detachment</a> can develop floaters and have acute vision loss.&nbsp; However, photopsia (flashes of lights) is common, and funduscopy typically demonstrates an elevated retina with folds and/or a tear.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Vitreous hemorrhage often presents with sudden-onset hazy vision or vision loss.&nbsp; Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a common risk factor.&nbsp; Examination frequently shows red blood cells or floating debris in the vitreous and a dark red glow with loss of fundal details on fundoscopy.</p>",
