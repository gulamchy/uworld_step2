A significantly <a href=\"34222\">elevated anion gap</a> of 29 mEq/L denotes an <strong>anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong> (AGMA).&nbsp; The most common cause of AGMA in adolescents is new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, which could explain this patient&#39;s symptoms; however, a normal serum glucose and negative ketones exclude this diagnosis <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p><p>Another <a href=\"4075\">potential cause</a> of AGMA is <strong>ingestion</strong> of a <strong>toxic alcohol</strong> (eg, ethylene glycol, methanol), which is common in patients who are suicidal or seeking inebriation but lack access to ethanol (eg, financially unable, underage).&nbsp; <strong>Methanol</strong> ingestion is highly likely in this patient given the ophthalmoscopic finding of optic disc hyperemia, which signifies <strong>optic neuritis</strong> caused by formic acid (the major toxic metabolite of methanol).&nbsp; <a href=\"17735\">Fomepizole</a> can be used to inhibit methanol metabolism into formic acid, and hemodialysis can be considered in severe cases.&nbsp; Although early treatment can partially reverse vision damage, full recovery is rare.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Aspirin overdose can also cause encephalopathy, abdominal pain, vomiting, and AGMA, but findings of optic neuritis (eg, optic disc hyperemia) would not be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Ethylene glycol and methanol toxicity both cause AGMA and encephalopathy.&nbsp; However, ethylene glycol ingestion does not cause optic neuritis; kidney dysfunction (tubular injury) due to calcium oxalate stone formation would more likely be present.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s elevated BUN is due to dehydration (volume depletion) from vomiting.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Toluene (a hydrocarbon found in many commercial products) is sometimes inhaled recreationally (eg, glue sniffing), particularly among adolescents because of ease of access.&nbsp; Although encephalopathy and abdominal symptoms can occur, optic neuritis would be rare.&nbsp; In addition, nonanion gap metabolic acidosis (not AGMA) would be typical, caused by toluene-induced type 1 renal tubular acidosis.&nbsp; AGMA can occasionally be seen in severe toxicity associated with kidney failure or lactic acidosis (both of which are absent in this patient).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Methanol toxicity is characterized by encephalopathy, abdominal pain/vomiting, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis.&nbsp; Optic neuritis is a common complication that distinguishes methanol ingestion from other toxic alcohol ingestions (eg, ethylene glycol).</p>",
