They can arise from <a href=\"35261\">factors</a> relating to the physician (eg, fatigue), the patient (eg, language barrier), or the system (eg, inefficient workflow).&nbsp; Diagnostic errors often result from <strong>cognitive bias</strong>, occurring when a physician&#39;s dependence on <strong>heuristics</strong> (ie, mental shortcuts) distorts clinical judgment and treatment.</p><p>This scenario illustrates several types of cognitive bias:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Framing bias</strong> occurred as the <strong>context of information</strong> (ie, medical record describing panic attack history and diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) <strong>incorrectly limited</strong> the physician&#39;s &#x22;frame&#x22; of analysis.&nbsp; This bias led to the assumption that tachycardia, shortness of breath, and anxiety also represented a panic attack, rather than possible pulmonary embolism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anchoring bias</strong> led to the physician fixating (&#x22;anchoring&#x22;) on a presumptive diagnosis of panic attack without considering alternate causes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> resulted in the physician&#39;s oversight of information contradicting the presumptive diagnosis, including the patient&#39;s risk factors of smoking and oral contraceptive use.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Communication error typically describes a breakdown in information relay, such as a change in clinical care or a lack of closed-loop communication within the medical team.&nbsp; In this scenario, there are no communication breakdowns to explain the patient&#39;s misdiagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Documentation error often occurs when information is omitted from the medical record (eg, not charting pertinent physical examination findings).&nbsp; There is no evidence of documentation error in this scenario.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Information bias describes the belief that more data is better, leading to overcollection of data, which can complicate efficient and accurate decision-making.&nbsp; In this case, the physician&#39;s cognitive bias resulted in collecting an insufficient, rather than an excessive, amount of data for diagnostic workup.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Latent errors are system-level factors, such as inefficient protocols or organizational structures, that cause adverse events.&nbsp; This case represents an active error (ie, relating to the physician&#39;s specific actions or judgement) caused by cognitive bias, rather than a system-level error.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Diagnostic errors are commonly caused by cognitive bias, including framing, anchoring, and confirmation bias.&nbsp;

            "questionText": "<p>Administrators at a busy multicenter hospital are concerned about a higher-than-average incidence of retained surgical objects (RSO) following complex abdominal surgery.&nbsp; Current hospital procedures require the circulating nurse and a scrub nurse to conduct an initial count of surgical sponges and instruments before surgery begins; this number must then be reconciled during a final count prior to finishing the procedure.&nbsp; However, the administrators find that most instances of RSO occurred even when nurses had followed hospital counting procedures and reconciled the final count.&nbsp; Upon reviewing video recordings of the teams working in the operative setting, the administrators note that counts are time-intensive, constituting 15% of total operation time.&nbsp; In addition, during the final count, nurses experience distractions, such as alarms and background music, and frequent interruptions from surgeons asking the nurses for items necessary to close the incision.&nbsp; Which of the following interventions is recommended to improve quality of the counting procedure in this setting?</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p><strong>Retained surgical objects</strong> (RSO) (eg, sponges, instruments) carry potentially serious patient consequences (eg, infection, reoperation).&nbsp; To detect RSO, hospitals typically require 2 nurses to reconcile counts of objects and instruments used during surgery.&nbsp; However, counting can be tedious, time-intensive, and error-prone; up to 80% of RSOs occur in cases that include an appropriate reconciliation count.</p><p><strong>Distractions</strong> and <strong>interruptions</strong> are a major contributor to counting errors.&nbsp; At this hospital, nurses are frequently interrupted by surgeons needing items (eg, tools, sutures) to close the incision, and the surgeons, who are concentrating on operative tasks, may be unaware that nurses have initiated the count.&nbsp; To reduce counting errors, a brief <strong>time-out</strong> (ie, a dedicated pause where nurses announce that a final count is about to begin) may be performed to improve team awareness.&nbsp; This can reduce counting errors through the following:</p><ul><li><p>Makes team members aware that an important safety action is about to begin, and that they should limit unnecessary interruptions</p></li><li><p>Allows the surgeons to request anticipated tools and items before the count, reducing interruptions once the count has started</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Addressing team authority levels and possible intimidation promotes free expression of safety concerns (eg, nurses freely voice concern about suspected count discrepancy).&nbsp; However, in this case, interruptions most likely occur from low situational awareness (eg, multitasking; surgeons unaware that counting has begun) rather than intimidation by surgeons.&nbsp; A time-out is more likely to increase awareness of safety proceedings and minimize interruptions, improving counting accuracy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Closed-loop communication, in which the receiver of a message repeats it back to the sender, prevents miscommunication.&nbsp; However, it would not address the frequency of interruptions or low situational awareness causing counting errors.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Counting procedures are already time-intensive; repeating the counts is likely to be impractical and does not address the distractable, interruption-prone environment.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Retained surgical objects (eg, sponges, instruments) frequently occur even when surgical counts are thought to be reconciled.&nbsp; Interruptions increase the risk of counting error; holding a brief time-out (ie, a pause in activities to announce that the count is about to begin) can improve situational awareness (ie, group vigilance for safety concerns), reduce interruptions, and improve count quality.</p>",

Knowledge deficiency (eg, insufficient ability to interpret clinical data) is a rarer cause of diagnostic error for practicing physicians compared with cognitive error.&nbsp; This physician&#39;s behavior started after a recent patient experience; therefore, knowledge deficiency regarding head CT imaging indications is unlikely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cognitive errors involve heuristics (mental shortcuts) incorrectly influencing clinical decision-making, resulting in diagnostic error.&nbsp;

In this case, <strong>communication breakdown</strong> caused inadvertent administration of intravenous vitamin K rather than oral potassium (sometimes given empirically because electrolyte abnormalities exacerbate arrhythmias), resulting in reversal of warfarin-induced anticoagulation (ie, subtherapeutic INR level).&nbsp; Miscommunication risk increases with <strong>verbal orders</strong>, which lack safety checkpoints (eg, computerized alerts indicating drug interactions).&nbsp; <strong>Abbreviations</strong> (eg, &#x22;20 of K,&#x22; instead of full dose and drug name) and <strong>indirect communication</strong> (eg, resident communication of attending&#39;s order) also increase error risk.</p><p><strong>Closed-loop communication</strong>, also known as <strong>&#x22;read-back&#x22; technique</strong>, is used by <strong>high-reliability organizations</strong> (eg, those with excellent safety records despite high risk) to minimize miscommunication.&nbsp; This technique is as follows:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p>Sender (eg, resident) conveys message (eg, specific potassium order) to receiver (eg, cross-covering provider).<p></li><li><p>Receiver repeats (reads back) the full interpreted message to sender.</p></li><li><p>Sender clarifies or confirms accuracy of message.<p></li></ol><p>Use of closed-loop communication would have identified and corrected this miscommunicated verbal order.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Visual cues, such as warning labels, can prevent confusion between look-alike or high-risk medications (eg, clear antibiotic solution bags with similar appearance to intravenous fluids).&nbsp; In this case, selection of the wrong drug resulted from a miscommunicated verbal order rather than confusion between look-alike medications.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Clinical decision support tools prompt providers who place orders using computerized systems to consider safety-promoting actions (eg, review drug-drug interaction).&nbsp; These tools are unlikely to generate alerts for vitamin K (which may be appropriate corrective therapy when INR reversal is desired); furthermore, they would not prevent errors from verbal orders.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Checklists improve safety by standardizing high-risk processes (eg, preventing incomplete sign-out) and administration of high-risk medications (eg, administering tissue plasminogen activator to patients with suspected stroke).&nbsp; Checklists and standardized sign-outs would not prevent incorrect drug selection resulting from miscommunication of real-time verbal orders.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Communication breakdowns, a leading cause of medical error, are more likely to occur with abbreviations, verbal orders, or third-party messages.&nbsp;
