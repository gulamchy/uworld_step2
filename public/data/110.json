Major risk factors include obesity, advancing age, diabetes, and prior joint injury.&nbsp; Most patients have pain with weight bearing and few associated symptoms, although a subset can develop swelling, rest pain, and brief (&lt;30 minutes) morning stiffness.&nbsp; Examination shows crepitus, periarticular bony enlargement, and painful or decreased range of motion.&nbsp; X-ray findings include <a href=\"657\">narrowed joint space, osteophytes</a>, and subchondral sclerosis/cysts.</p><p>Synovial effusions are common in older patients with OA; communication of the joint space with the gastrocnemius or semimembranosus bursa allows the synovial fluid to flow posteriorly into the bursa, forming a <strong>popliteal (Baker) cyst</strong>.&nbsp; Effusions can also form in a variety of other arthritic conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], crystalline arthritis) or knee injury.&nbsp; Arthrocentesis can be used to distinguish the underlying etiology; joint fluid cell counts in osteoarthritis are usually significantly lower than in RA or crystal-induced arthritis.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Calcification of joint cartilage (<a href=\"118\">chondrocalcinosis</a>) is seen in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (pseudogout); synovial fluid shows an inflammatory effusion with rhomboid, positively birefringent crystals.&nbsp; Gout causes an inflammatory effusion and needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals; x-rays characteristically show <a href=\"2036\">punched-out erosions</a> with a rim of cortical bone.&nbsp; Both gout and pseudogout are characterized by recurrent flares of pain rather than chronic, progressive pain.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; X-ray in septic arthritis will show a normal joint space with swelling of adjacent soft tissues.&nbsp; Synovial fluid characteristically has a very high cell count with visible organisms on Gram stain.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; RA can cause popliteal cyst formation, but the synovial fluid in RA shows an inflammatory effusion.&nbsp; In addition, it typically also involves the small, nonweightbearing joints of the hands and is associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue), prolonged (vs brief) morning stiffness (eg, &#8805;30 minutes), and synovitis (warm, spongy joints).&nbsp; X-rays reveal periarticular osteopenia with erosions of the joint margin.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Physical examination in osteoarthritis shows crepitus, periarticular bony enlargement, and painful or decreased range of motion.&nbsp; X-ray findings include a narrowed joint space, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis/cysts.&nbsp; Patients can also have a bland synovial effusion (no organisms, &lt;2,000 white blood cells/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).</p>",

SS, classically triggered by exposure to foreign proteins (eg, antitoxins, murine/chimeric monoclonal antibodies), is due high-titer immune complex (IC) generation, IC tissue deposition, and excessive classical complement cascade activation.&nbsp; In contrast, SSLR is not associated with ICs or complement activation; although the exact etiology is unclear, cases may reflect drug-related hapten formation or direct lymphocyte cytotoxicity triggered by exposure to beta-lactam (eg, cefaclor, <strong>penicillins</strong>) or sulfa (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) drugs.</p><p>Both SS and SSLR present with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fever</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Urticarial rash:</strong>&nbsp; intensely pruritic plaques that <strong>spare the mucous membranes</strong> and typically persist for &gt;24 hours</p></li><li><p><strong>Arthralgia:</strong>&nbsp; polyarticular joint pain that worsens with movement and palpation.&nbsp; Signs of arthritis (eg, overlying erythema, warmth, edema) are not typically present but may occasionally occur</p></li></ul><p>Some patients also have mild proteinuria or <strong>diffuse lymphadenopathy</strong>.&nbsp; Compared to SS, SSLR is usually less severe (eg, low-grade fever, less likely to cause systemic manifestations) and is more common in <strong>children</strong>.&nbsp; Manifestations typically begin within <strong>5-14 days</strong> of medication initiation and resolve spontaneously with medication discontinuation.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Acute rheumatic fever is marked by fever, <a href=\"40866\">erythema marginatum</a> rash, and arthritis.&nbsp; However, the arthritis is migratory and accompanied by marked joint swelling; the rash is nonpruritic; and many patients have carditis.&nbsp; In addition, rheumatic fever is extremely rare in patients who receive prompt treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Anaphylaxis is a IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction that occurs within minutes of drug exposure.&nbsp;
