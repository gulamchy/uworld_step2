These are the 2 most disabling symptoms of COPD, often leading to sedentary behavior, deconditioning of peripheral and respiratory muscles, and worsening dyspnea/fatigue in a vicious cycle.</p><p><strong>Pulmonary rehabilitation</strong>&nbsp;is a multidisciplinary program designed to interrupt this cycle; it consists of 4 components:</p><ul><li>Supervised <strong>exercise</strong>:&nbsp; intended to build muscle mass and increase the efficiency of peripheral muscle oxygen use, leading to improved exercise capacity although lung function is unchanged</li></ul><ul><li><p>Disease management <strong>education</strong>:&nbsp; includes inhaler technique teaching, breath training (eg, pursed lip), counseling on vaccinations, COPD action planning (early treatment of exacerbations), and other topics</p></li><li><p><strong>Nutritional</strong> intervention:&nbsp; includes a dietary plan to address nutritional comorbidities very frequently associated with COPD (eg, excessive weight, pulmonary cachexia, glycemic control)</p></li><li><p><strong>Psychosocial</strong> support:&nbsp; includes smoking cessation, support for psychological comorbidities (eg, anxiety, depression), and identification of financial and social resources (eg, medication assistance, peer group)</p></li></ul><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is indicated for patients with chronic lung disease who have functional impairment due to their symptoms.&nbsp; Delivered over 12 weeks, the goal is to create <strong>positive lifelong change</strong> by motivating and improving the patient&#39;s sense of disease mastery.&nbsp; Pulmonary rehabilitation improves dyspnea and exercise tolerance, increases quality of life, <strong>enhances functional status</strong> (eg, daily activities, return to work), <strong>decreases hospital admissions</strong>, and reduces mortality in patients with COPD.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Chest physiotherapy (eg, percussion vest) is indicated to mobilize secretions for patients with prominent chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis who have mucus stasis.&nbsp; This patient has dry emphysema with minimal mucus congestion (eg, mild productive cough, no mucus impaction on CT scan).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with COPD and significant hypoxemia at rest (SaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> &#8804;88% or PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> &#8804;55 mm Hg).&nbsp;

However, they do not restore functional status or reduce hospital admissions.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, alprazolam) are generally avoided for management of anxiety, and are especially disfavored in patients with COPD because they increase the risk of pulmonary complications (eg, aspiration, respiratory depression).&nbsp; Anxiety, particularly when driven by dyspnea from chronic lung disease, tends to respond favorably with the nonpharmacologic interventions of pulmonary rehabilitation.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary program of exercise, education, nutritional therapy, and psychosocial support for patients with functional limitation due to chronic lung disease.&nbsp; It improves dyspnea, functional status, and quality of life.</p>",

Acute asthma typically causes respiratory alkalosis (&#8593; pH, &#8595; PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) due to increased respiratory drive.&nbsp; Therefore, <strong>elevated</strong> or even <strong>inappropriately normal PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font></strong> is concerning for respiratory muscle fatigue.</p><p>Although this patient&#39;s PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (48 mm Hg) is not significantly elevated, it signals impending failure, given his tachypnea and high work of breathing (ie, extreme effort to maintain relatively normal ventilation).&nbsp; Absence of wheezing (&#x22;silent chest&#x22;) is another alarming sign, signifying poor tidal air movement.&nbsp; Severe asthma can cause significant lower airway obstruction (eg, inflammation, bronchospasm); the full effect of pharmacologic therapy (nebulized bronchodilators, systemic steroids, IV magnesium) will likely be delayed.&nbsp; Therefore, the immediate priority is to stabilize the exacerbation with <strong>mechanical ventilation</strong> (noninvasive [face mask] or invasive [intubation]) as a bridge to recovery.</p><p>A time-limited (&lt;2 hr) trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) can be considered in select patients.&nbsp; However, unlike with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), data on mortality and intubation rates with NIPPV in asthma exacerbations are scarce and weak.&nbsp; NIPPV instantly improves COPD-related hyperinflation, in which collapsible airways can be stented open by extrinsic pressure.&nbsp; In contrast, severe asthma is marked by concentric smooth muscle hypertrophy, and exacerbations typically involve inflammatory edematous airway closure that is not as readily relieved by positive pressure.&nbsp; Therefore, there is a <strong>low threshold</strong> to <strong>intubate</strong> and begin mechanical ventilation.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; This patient has received appropriate drug therapy for status asthmaticus; however, relief of bronchoconstriction will likely take hours to days.&nbsp; At present, his borderline respiratory acidosis indicates impending respiratory failure.&nbsp; Mechanical ventilation is needed to prevent worsening acidosis and hypercapnia, which can lead to cardiac arrest.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous antibiotics are not recommended for asthma exacerbations because viral infections are the most common trigger; no benefit from antibiotic therapy has been demonstrated.&nbsp; It is not unusual for leukocytes to be elevated, as in this patient, due to acute stress response (demargination) rather than infection.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline) or systemic epinephrine provides no additional benefit over inhaled beta agonists and muscarinic antagonists for acute asthma exacerbations.&nbsp; Systemic (usually intramuscular) epinephrine is reserved for bronchospasm associated with anaphylaxis.&nbsp; Rather than additional pharmacotherapy with little/marginal benefit, this patient requires mechanical support to assist ventilation.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>In patients with severe, acute asthma, elevated or inappropriately normal PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> suggests respiratory muscle weakness and impending respiratory failure, which require mechanical ventilatory support.</p>",

Management of AECOPD addresses the infectious and inflammatory processes:</p><ul><li><p>Antibiotics, which are given to select patients, offer empiric coverage of commensal bacterial flora (eg, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) to reduce bacterial burden and dampen the attendant inflammatory response.</p></li><li><p><strong>Systemic glucocorticoids</strong> (eg, prednisone, methylprednisolone), which are given to all patients, reduce airway inflammation to lessen bronchial wall edema and secretions and improve expiratory airflow.&nbsp; A typical treatment duration is 5-7 days; oral and intravenous administration is considered equivalent, but the latter may be required for patients who are too dyspneic to swallow.</p></li></ul><p>Systemic glucocorticoids should be administered even when there is an underlying infectious trigger because respiratory dysfunction is mostly driven by the infection-elicited inflammatory response rather than the pathogen itself.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone) and long-acting beta agonists (eg, salmeterol) are used for long-term control of asthma, but they have no role in treatment of AECOPD.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous magnesium sulfate is a smooth muscle relaxant that produces bronchodilation to treat severe asthma exacerbations.&nbsp; It has minimal effect in AECOPD, which involves expiratory small airway collapse (emphysema) and mucus hypersecretion (chronic bronchitis), rather than intense smooth muscle constriction.</p><p><strong>(Choices E)</strong>&nbsp; Nebulized epinephrine is used for treatment of croup, wherein it produces mucosal vasoconstriction to reduce laryngeal or epiglottic edema.&nbsp; Upper airway edema is not a significant component of AECOPD.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Nebulized hypertonic saline is sometimes used to thin respiratory secretions in patients with significant mucostasis (eg, bronchiectasis).&nbsp; It can be a supportive adjunct for AECOPD associated with tenacious secretions (absent in this patient); however, it does not alter outcomes or recovery.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Oral furosemide is indicated for patients with decompensated heart failure, which is characterized by orthopnea, wet inspiratory crackles, and vascular congestion or pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.</p><p><strong>(Choice H)</strong>&nbsp; Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, is used for AECOPD prophylaxis in patients with frequent exacerbations; however, it has no role in acute treatment.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be treated with systemic glucocorticoids, even in the setting of an infectious trigger, to inhibit the cascade of airway inflammation.</p>",

Asthma is an atopic disease with a strong genetic contribution and early life onset; COPD (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) is due primarily to tobacco use and presents later in life.&nbsp; In practice, <strong>asthma and COPD often overlap</strong> in age of onset and clinical manifestations.&nbsp;

Although expiratory views may accentuate air trapping, findings are nonspecific and do not discriminate between asthma and COPD.&nbsp; Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide can help distinguish between the forms of COPD (chronic bronchitis [near-normal] and emphysema [low]) but not between COPD and asthma (normal or high due to bronchial hyperemia).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Inherited alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes autoproteolysis of lung tissue, leading to panacinar emphysema and irreversible obstruction; testing should be considered in patients with premature-onset COPD disproportionate to smoking history.&nbsp;
