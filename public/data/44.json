            "explanationText": "<p>The clinical presentation and the chest x-ray of this patient is suggestive of pleural effusion with or without a lung mass. A pleural effusion is present when there is an excess quantity of fluid in the pleural space. When pleural effusion is suspected or diagnosed, the first step is to determine the cause of pleural effusion, and management starts with determining whether the fluid is transudate or exudate. Diagnostic thoracentesis is the preliminary investigation of choice in the management of pleural effusion, except in patients with classic signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, where a trial of a diuretic is warranted.</p><p>Diagnostic thoracentesis is a bedside, minimally-invasive procedure that permits fluid to be rapidly sampled, visualized, examined microscopically, and quantified. Pleural fluid analysis provides decision-making information in 90% of cases. If a diagnostic thoracentesis shows exudative pleural fluid, further diagnostic investigations are indicated.</p><p>Malignant pleural effusion is very likely in this patient, who is a chronic smoker, presenting with weight loss and pleural effusion. A CT scan will most likely show a lung or mediastinal mass in this patient. Diagnostic thoracentesis would determine the type of pleural fluid (transudative fluid would rule out malignant effusion) and may also show malignant cells. Lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and lymphoma are the three tumors that cause approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions.</p><p><strong>(Choices A, B, D, and E)</strong> are all useful in evaluating the cause of exudative pleural effusion; however, the first step in the management of pleural effusion is diagnostic thoracentesis to determine whether the etiology is transudative or exudative. Bronchoscopy is a close alternative in this case; however, this requires sedation and is considered to be a relatively invasive procedure. This will be the next step if the pleural fluid cytology is non-diagnostic and the patient has lung mass. If the pleural fluid cytology is positive for lung cancer, then the patient does not require a&nbsp;bronchoscopy.</p><p><b>(Choices F and G) </b>Diuretics and echocardiography are indicated in patients with heart failure. In that case, patients present with fluid overload (weight gain), pedal edema, and, on exam, crackles are heard on both lung bases.</p><p><b>Educational Objective:</b><br>Undiagnosed pleural effusion is best evaluated with thoracentesis, except in patients with clear-cut evidence of congestive heart failure.</p><p>*Extremely high yield question for USMLE!!!</p>",

because sodium handling by the kidney is intact and the patient is euvolemic, all of the solute from each 1 L of NS is excreted in &lt;1 L of urine (water in &gt; water out), which worsens hyponatremia.</li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Dilutional hyponatremia with appropriately suppressed antidiuretic hormone secretion can occur due to excess free water intake (eg, psychogenic polydipsia).&nbsp; The kidneys respond appropriately with excretion of very dilute urine (&lt;100 mOsm/kg H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>O); however, the capacity to excrete water becomes overwhelmed and euvolemic hyponatremia develops.&nbsp; This patient has no evidence of excessive free water intake; the free water content in ~5 L of normal saline is not high enough to cause significant dilutional hyponatremia in the absence of SIADH;
