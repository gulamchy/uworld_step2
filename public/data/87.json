First-line empiric treatment when <em>N gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C trachomatis</em> status are unknown is a single dose of <strong>intramuscular ceftriaxone</strong> plus a 7-day course of <strong>oral doxycycline</strong>, which provides dual coverage (ceftriaxone plus doxycycline) against potential <em>N gonorrhoeae</em> infection and monotherapy (doxycycline) against potential <em>Chlamydia</em> infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although azithromycin is first-line treatment for isolated <em>C trachomatis</em> infections, it is no longer recommended for empiric therapy when gonococcus is (or may be) present due to increasing rates of azithromycin resistance in this organism.&nbsp; Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for infectious urethritis due to <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>; however, this organism is not part of initial testing or empiric treatment because it is a less common cause of urethritis in men.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole provides coverage against many coliform organisms (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>).&nbsp; Although older men with prostatic hypertrophy are at risk for infectious urethritis with coliform bacteria, these organisms are uncommon in young men and are often associated with positive nitrites on urinalysis.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Therapy should not be delayed for test results due to high risk of transmission to others and progressive disease.&nbsp; Empiric treatment at the time of care is recommended, with NAAT obtained to confirm the diagnosis and causative organism and to potentially inform management decisions (eg, in case of recurrent or persistent symptoms).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Infectious urethritis in young men is usually due to sexually transmitted infection.&nbsp; Nucleic acid amplification testing provides confirmation, but patients with suspected infection should be treated at the time of care.&nbsp; When the organism is unknown, ceftriaxone plus doxycycline is recommended to cover <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, the 2 most common organisms.</p>",

Therefore, HAV vaccination is recommended for patients with HIV who do not have evidence of immunity (ie, negative serum anti-HAV), regardless of other risk factors. &nbsp;This is&nbsp;particularly relevant for those with longstanding HIV infection or other HAV risk factors (eg, men who have sex with men).&nbsp;

This is not typically seen during most other stages of syphilis (eg, early latent syphilis) <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Early primary syphilis:</strong>&nbsp; In early primary syphilis, nontreponemal serology often becomes positive a week or two after treponemal serology; therefore, patients who present with a chancre sometimes have negative nontreponemal and positive treponemal serology despite active infection.&nbsp; Retesting nontreponemal serology a few weeks later will usually show seroconversion.</p></li></ul><p>In contrast, many patients who have not been infected with syphilis have <strong>positive nontreponemal and negative treponemal serology</strong> because nontreponemal serology is not specific for syphilis antigens; this type of discordance is seen most often in pregnancy, intravenous drug use, liver disease, HIV, and autoimmune conditions <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Serologic tests for syphilis rely on the detection of antibodies; therefore, certain disorders (eg, combined variable immunodeficiency) associated with impaired antibody production can lead to false-negative testing.&nbsp; However, both FTA-ABS and VDRL would likely be negative.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Syphilis is diagnosed when nontreponemal and treponemal serology is positive.&nbsp; Negative nontreponemal and positive treponemal serology is seen with appropriately treated infection, late untreated syphilis, and early primary syphilis (eg, chancre).&nbsp; Positive nontreponemal and negative treponemal serology is often linked to pregnancy, intravenous drug use, liver disease, HIV, and autoimmune conditions.</p>",
