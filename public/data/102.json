Patients with high-risk pregnancies or acute obstetric conditions (eg, suspected PPROM, vaginal bleeding, decreased fetal movement) require evaluation for <strong>fetal well-being</strong> with a <strong>nonstress test (NST)</strong>, which is continuous fetal heart rate monitoring for 20-40 minutes.&nbsp; An NST result is normal (ie, <a href=\"22904\">reactive</a>) if &#8805;2 fetal heart rate accelerations are present (with normal baseline, variability, and no decelerations), indicating that fetal oxygenation is adequate and the risk of fetal acidemia is low.</p><p>In contrast, this patient has a <strong>nonreactive NST</strong> result (ie, <a href=\"36210\">&lt;2 accelerations</a>), which can be due to a benign cause (eg, fetal sleep cycle) or indicate potential fetal hypoxia/acidemia.&nbsp; Because a nonreactive NST result is nonspecific, it requires further evaluation with a <strong>biophysical profile (BPP)</strong>, an ultrasound test that assigns a score of 0 or 2 to each of the following 5 parameters: NST, fetal tone, movement, breathing, and amniotic fluid.&nbsp; An <strong>8 of 10 score</strong>, as in this patient (ie, &#8722;2 for nonreactive NST), is <strong>normal</strong>.&nbsp; Patients with a nonreactive NST result and normal BPP score receive <strong>reassurance and routine care</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Patients at continued risk for acute fetal deterioration (eg, after maternal abdominal trauma, bleeding placenta previa) require 24-hour continuous monitoring.&nbsp; This patient is not at risk for acute fetal compromise, so continuous monitoring is not necessary.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; A contraction stress test is used to assess fetal well-being if BPP results are equivocal (ie, score of 6 of 10).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Immediate delivery may be indicated for severe recurrent fetal heart rate decelerations, which typically indicate fetal hypoxia and acidemia.&nbsp; In contrast, a nonreactive NST result is followed by evaluation with a BPP.&nbsp; If the BPP result is also abnormal (eg, no fetal tone, no fetal movement), delivery may be indicated.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonography is used to monitor fetal growth restriction (ie, estimated fetal weight &lt;10th percentile).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s pregnancy has been uncomplicated.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>In the assessment of fetal well-being, a nonreactive nonstress test result (ie, &lt;2 fetal heart rate accelerations in 20-40 minutes) is nonspecific for fetal hypoxia and acidemia and requires further evaluation with a biophysical profile (BPP).&nbsp; A normal BPP score is 8-10 of 10.&nbsp; Patients with a nonreactive nonstress test result and normal BPP score receive reassurance and routine care.</p>",
