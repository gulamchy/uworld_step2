The unifying feature of amyloidogenic disorders (eg, AL, AA, age-related) is misfolded proteins that form fibrils and deposit in extracellular tissues, causing organ dysfunction.&nbsp; AL amyloidosis results from <a href=\"65265\">misfolded immunoglobulin light chain proteins</a> produced in excess by plasma cell dyscrasias (eg, multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia).</p><p>The type of misfolded protein influences which organs are typically affected by each form of amyloid, although some overlap exists.&nbsp; AL amyloidosis commonly presents with kidney involvement manifesting as <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> (heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, pitting edema).&nbsp; Also prominent are <strong>hepatomegaly</strong> and restrictive cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; The deposits can lead to <strong>waxy, tight skin</strong> (epidermal deposits); macroglossia; and peripheral neuropathy.&nbsp; <strong>Periorbital purpura</strong> is a rare but highly characteristic finding that may reflect protein infiltration causing a bleeding diathesis (eg, due to factor X sequestration in the liver) and weakening of vessel walls leading to hemorrhage.</p><p>Because of its potential response to chemotherapy, AL amyloidosis requires differentiation from the other types of systemic amyloidosis.&nbsp; The presence of a clonal <strong>plasma cell dyscrasia</strong> is confirmed by serum and urine protein electrophoresis, free light chain assay, and/or bone marrow biopsy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy with cutaneous manifestations.&nbsp; <a href=\"44499\">Heliotrope eruption</a> (violaceous erythema) of the eyelids is a pathognomonic sign.&nbsp; Although this finding may be confused with purpura, progressive proximal muscle weakness would be the predominant manifestation, and nephrotic syndrome is atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hashimoto thyroiditis results from autoimmune thyroid destruction and causes hypothyroidism.&nbsp; Fatigue is common, and lower extremity edema can occur but is typically nonpitting (<a href=\"26452\">myxedema</a>, reflecting glycosaminoglycan infiltration).&nbsp; Periorbital edema is sometimes present, but purpura is not characteristic.&nbsp; Hepatomegaly and nephrotic syndrome are rare.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Sarcoidosis can affect any organ but most frequently presents with lung involvement.&nbsp; Granulomatous infiltration on biopsy of the liver and kidney is common; however, hepatomegaly and nephrotic syndrome are uncommon.&nbsp; Skin lesions are variable and usually present as papules, nodules, or plaques rather than purpura.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic sclerosis causes progressive skin and internal organ fibrosis.&nbsp; Although patients with edema may feel skin tightness, scleroderma denotes visible skin thickening and hardening that is nonpitting and typically involves the face and hands (ie, <a href=\"54081\">sclerodactyly</a>).&nbsp; Periorbital purpura, nephrotic syndrome, and hepatomegaly are not typically present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>AL amyloidosis most commonly presents as nephrotic syndrome.&nbsp; Hepatomegaly and restrictive cardiomyopathy are other frequent manifestations.&nbsp; Periorbital purpura is a rare but highly characteristic skin finding.</p>",
