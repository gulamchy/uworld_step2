TEF with EA is also less commonly associated with <strong>CHARGE syndrome</strong> (<strong>C</strong>oloboma, <strong>H</strong>eart defects, <strong>A</strong>tresia choanae, <strong>R</strong>etardation of growth, <strong>G</strong>enitourinary anomalies, and <strong>E</strong>ar abnormalities).</p><p>For this reason, evaluation of all patients who have TEF with EA should include screening <strong>echocardiography</strong> and <strong>renal ultrasonography</strong>.&nbsp; Contrast enema (to detect anal atresia) and limb radiographs may also be performed if clinical suspicion for VACTERL association is high.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Dilated funduscopic examination is indicated for an abnormal red reflex (eg, leukocoria) to detect retinoblastoma, which does not occur in association with TEF with EA.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Hepatic ultrasonography is performed to screen for hepatoblastoma in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (eg, hemihyperplasia, macroglossia), features of which are not seen in this patient.&nbsp; In addition, liver abnormalities are not part of the VACTERL association.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Gastroesophageal reflux can cause spitting up with feeds, and additional evaluation is not typically warranted.&nbsp; However, coughing during feeds and resistance to nasogastric tube advancement are not consistent with reflux.&nbsp; Further workup is required in this patient due to the association of TEF with VACTERL.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Features of congenital hypothyroidism include hypotonia, umbilical hernia, feeding problems, and macroglossia, none of which is seen here.&nbsp; TEF is not associated with thyroid dysfunction, making thyroid function testing unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) with esophageal atresia (EA) presents shortly after birth with choking or coughing during feeding.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed by resistance of nasogastric tube advancement beyond the proximal esophagus.&nbsp; Because TEF with EA often occurs with VACTERL association (<strong>V</strong>ertebral, <strong>A</strong>nal, <strong>C</strong>ardiac, <strong>T</strong>racheo<strong>E</strong>sophageal fistula, <strong>R</strong>enal, and/or <strong>L</strong>imb anomalies), all patients who have TEF with EA should undergo screening echocardiography and renal ultrasonography.</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p>This patient with episodes of jaw pain and swelling (eg, tender mass) that are exacerbated by eating, are associated with fever,&nbsp;and resolve with antibiotics likely has <strong>recurrent sialadenitis</strong> (salivary gland infection).&nbsp; Sialadenitis is caused by salivary stasis that leads to retrograde seeding of bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, oral flora) from the oral cavity.&nbsp; Salivary stasis can be seen in elderly postoperative patients or in those with obstruction of the outflow duct.&nbsp; In this patient with no other known risk factors, salivary stasis is likely due to ductal obstruction by salivary stones <strong>(sialolithiasis)</strong>.</p><p>Salivary stones most often form in the submandibular, rather than the parotid, glands because saliva from the submandibular glands has a higher mucus content and the duct travels against gravity, resulting in decreased salivary flow.&nbsp; These stones are most commonly made of calcium and are visible on CT scan.</p><p><strong>Sialolithiasis</strong> typically presents with pain and swelling <strong>exacerbated by eating</strong>.&nbsp; In some patients, management with hydration, moist heat, milking of the gland, and sialagogues is sufficient to control symptoms and even flush out the stone.&nbsp; However, in other patients (such as this one), ductal obstruction leads to <strong>secondary infections</strong> (sialadenitis).&nbsp; Although these episodes typically respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics, patients with recurrent infections should be referred to otolaryngology for stone removal.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Giant cell arteritis can present with jaw pain exacerbated by eating.&nbsp; However, pain due to jaw claudication would worsen during chewing and improve shortly after cessation.&nbsp; In addition, pain would not resolve with antibiotic treatment, and a tender submandibular mass would not be present.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Sj&ouml;gren syndrome can present with salivary gland enlargement (typically painless) due to lymphocytic infiltration of the glands.&nbsp; However, patients are typically women, it more often affects the parotid glands, and secretions are significantly decreased, resulting in both xerostomia and dry eyes.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Temporomandibular joint disorder can present with episodic pain exacerbated by eating with intervening asymptomatic periods.&nbsp; However, patients would not have fever or a submandibular mass.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Trigeminal neuralgia can present with recurrent pain in the jaw (V2 and V3 branches of the trigeminal nerve) often triggered by minor stimuli like eating or brushing teeth.&nbsp; However, episodes last several seconds rather than a few days, and fever and a submandibular mass would not be present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Salivary stones occur most often in the submandibular glands and can present with recurrent sialadenitis due to obstruction of the duct.</p>",
