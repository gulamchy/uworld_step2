            "explanationText": "<p>This patient&#39;s clinical presentation, with a small ulcer developing&nbsp;at the site of a recent bite, is highly suggestive of a <strong>brown recluse spider bite</strong>.&nbsp; Such bites commonly occur as patients are putting their clothes on.&nbsp; They are often painless and may initially go unrecognized, but some bites are painful or cause a burning sensation.&nbsp; Many cases result in a small papule that heals in days to weeks.&nbsp; However, in some cases, a deep skin <strong>ulcer</strong> develops at the bite site over the course of a few days, with an erythematous halo and a&nbsp;<strong>necrotic center</strong> that can progress to an eschar.</p><p>With basic wound management, the lesion often heals without scarring. &nbsp;Debridement should be avoided in the early stages of necrosis but&nbsp;may facilitate healing once the lesion is stable and well-demarcated; severe cases may require skin grafting.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; By contrast to brown recluse spider bites, black widow spider bites often lead to more pronounced local and systemic manifestations due to effects of the toxin. &nbsp;These include muscle pain (a prominent finding),&nbsp;abdominal rigidity (sometimes mimicking&nbsp;a surgical abdomen),&nbsp;and muscle cramps (seen in &gt;60% of patients). &nbsp;Wound ulceration is uncommon, and&nbsp;patients commonly develop nausea and vomiting within hours of the bite, making this an unlikely diagnosis in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice B</strong><strong>)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthritis, arrhythmias, and facial palsy can occur as late complications of Lyme disease; these typically do not develop until months after the tick bite. &nbsp;The initial rash, erythema migrans,&nbsp;is classically a target lesion with central clearing (not ulceration)&nbsp;at the site of tick bite. &nbsp;The tick must remain attached for ~48 hours before transmission occurs.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and D)&nbsp;</strong> Hemoglobinuria, bleeding, and muscle paralysis may be seen with snakebites, which would cause&nbsp;severe local pain, swelling, and discoloration within hours of the bite.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Brown recluse spider bites can cause a deep necrotic ulcer at the bite site. &nbsp;The ulcer can progress over days to an eschar.</p>",

EHS is a heat-related illness characterized by a <strong>core temperature &gt;40 C (104 F)</strong> associated with <strong>CNS dysfunction</strong> (eg, altered mental status [AMS], seizure); these features help differentiate EHS from heat exhaustion (no CNS dysfunction, hyperthermia &#8804;40 C [104 F]).&nbsp; EHS typically occurs in otherwise healthy persons who are exercising in extreme heat or high humidity, which interferes with the body&#39;s ability to undergo evaporative cooling from sweat.&nbsp; Other risk factors for EHS include obesity, poor exercise tolerance, limited acclimatization to current weather conditions, and certain medications (eg, anticholinergics, <strong>antipsychotics</strong> such as quetiapine) that interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>Other signs and symptoms of EHS include <strong>hypotension</strong>, <strong>tachycardia</strong>, hyperventilation, flushing, and diarrhea.&nbsp; Diaphoresis may occur, depending on volume status.&nbsp; Oxidative stress and tissue hypoxia can result in rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and end-organ dysfunction (eg, renal or hepatic failure, pulmonary edema).</p><p>First-line management involves rapid cooling with <strong>ice water immersion</strong>.&nbsp; If an ice water bath is not available, alternative cooling methods (eg, cold water shower) should be used.&nbsp; Because EHS is primarily due to impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms rather than cytokine production, there is no role for antipyretic therapy (eg, acetaminophen).&nbsp; Morbidity and mortality are directly associated with the duration of hyperthermia; therefore, fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities should be considered only after cooling has begun.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cyproheptadine is used to treat serotonin syndrome, which can occasionally occur with quetiapine use but is more commonly seen with serotonin-modulating medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tramadol).&nbsp; Although serotonin syndrome also causes hyperthermia and AMS, hyperreflexia is typical, and EHS is more likely in a patient performing prolonged exercise.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Dantrolene is used in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can develop in patients taking antipsychotic agents (eg, quetiapine), and malignant hyperthermia (MH), which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals given inhalation anesthetics.&nbsp; Both can cause hyperthermia, tachycardia, and AMS.&nbsp; However, muscle rigidity is typically present.&nbsp; In addition, NMS symptoms generally develop over several days (not 2 hours), and MH occurs within minutes of anesthesia administration (not months later).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; High-dose ceftriaxone with vancomycin is first-line therapy for bacterial meningitis, which presents with high fever, neck stiffness, and AMS.&nbsp; Meningitis is unlikely in this patient who was well prior to basketball practice.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Oral hydration and Trendelenburg positioning are appropriate for exercise-associated collapse, which occurs in conditioned athletes immediately after cessation of exercise due to a sudden decrease in cardiac preload.&nbsp; Although syncope can occur, prolonged AMS and severe hyperthermia are unexpected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Exertional heat stroke is characterized by temperature &gt;40 C (104 F) and CNS dysfunction (eg, altered mental status, seizure).&nbsp; First-line treatment is rapid cooling with ice water immersion.</p>",

Nicotine poisoning is a <strong>life-threatening emergency</strong> that can occur from accidental or intentional exposure to nicotine by ingestion (eg, cigarette ends, concentrated liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes), inhalation, or transdermal absorption (eg, green tobacco sickness).&nbsp; Children are particularly vulnerable (eg, accidental ingestion of e-cigarette liquid nicotine), and toxicity is based on the amount of nicotine ingested.</p><p>Mild cases can present with gastrointestinal symptoms only.&nbsp; Severe ingestions can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.&nbsp; Patients typically have a <strong>biphasic response</strong> due to the differential effects of nicotine at different concentrations.</p><ul><li><p>Early phase (&lt;1 hr) is the <strong>stimulatory phase</strong> resulting from the relatively small concentration of nicotine acting as an agonist at the nicotinic receptors.&nbsp; Symptoms include agitation, nausea/vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, myoclonus, and seizures, which are consistent with sympathetic stimulation.</p></li><li><p>Late phase (~1-4 hr) is the <strong>inhibitory phase</strong>.&nbsp; Larger concentrations of nicotine overwhelm the nicotinic receptors, resulting in functional inhibition that can manifest as delayed parasympathetic effects (eg, bradycardia, hypotension, coma) and neuromuscular blockade (eg, muscle paralysis, weakness).</p></li></ul><p>Nicotine also commonly produces variable muscarinic effects, including sialorrhea (ie, drooling), wheezing, and diarrhea, as seen in this patient.&nbsp; <strong>Treatment</strong> is primarily <strong>supportive</strong> (eg, intravenous fluids, airway management).&nbsp; Benzodiazepines are used for seizures; atropine is effective for symptomatic bradycardia and muscarinic symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Anaphylaxis can present with the acute onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea), wheezing, and tachycardia.&nbsp; However, cutaneous findings (eg, pruritus, urticaria) and airway swelling are also usually present.&nbsp; Hypotension (not hypertension) would be expected, and myoclonus does not occur.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Children unimmunized against <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b are at increased risk for epiglottitis.&nbsp; Presentation often includes drooling, but fever, dysphagia, and respiratory distress (eg, with stridor rather than wheezing) would also be expected.&nbsp; Vomiting, diarrhea, and myoclonus would not be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and E)</strong>&nbsp; Intussusception typically presents at age 6-36 months with sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting; lethargy and AMS can occur if symptoms progress.&nbsp; Viral gastroenteritis is characterized by the acute onset of vomiting and diarrhea; tachycardia and, in severe cases, AMS may occur with high fever or dehydration.&nbsp; However, hypertension, wheezing, drooling, and myoclonus are not associated with these conditions.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Nicotine poisoning is a life-threatening emergency characterized by a biphasic response in which an initial stimulatory phase (eg, agitation, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, myoclonus) is followed by an inhibitory phase (eg, hypotension, bradycardia, coma).&nbsp;

An elevated <a href=\"34222\">anion gap</a> of 24 mEq/L indicates an <strong>anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong> (AGMA).&nbsp; These findings, in conjunction with <strong>acute kidney injury</strong> (AKI), urinary <strong>calcium oxalate crystals</strong>, and hypocalcemia (due to calcium oxalate formation) should raise suspicion for ethylene glycol toxicity.</p><p><strong>Ethylene glycol</strong> is a toxic alcohol commonly found in antifreeze and brake fluid.&nbsp; When ingested, it mimics ethanol intoxication.&nbsp; Ethylene glycol is metabolized by <strong>alcohol dehydrogenase</strong> into the toxic compounds glycolic acid and oxalic acid.&nbsp; Accumulation of these organic acids causes AGMA and <strong>organ damage</strong>, including nephrolithiasis (ie, calcium oxalate crystals) and AKI (ie, direct nephrotoxicity).&nbsp; Treatment primarily involves the following 3 components:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition</strong> to <a href=\"17735\">prevent the formation</a> of toxic organic acids; the preferred antidote for ethylene glycol (and methanol) toxicity is <strong>fomepizole</strong>, but ethanol can be used if fomepizole is unavailable</p></li><li><p><strong>Correction of acidemia</strong> via administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate to decrease tissue penetration of toxic organic compounds</p></li><li><p><strong>Hemodialysis</strong> to rapidly remove preformed toxic organic acids and parent alcohols, particularly in the presence of AGMA or end-organ damage</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Antibiotics are indicated for treatment of acute pyelonephritis, which typically presents with unilateral costovertebral angle tenderness and fever.&nbsp; This patient has bilateral tenderness and no fever, making pyelonephritis unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hydroxocobalamin is the antidote for cyanide poisoning, which is generally seen secondary to fires and occupational exposure (eg, mining, pest control).&nbsp; Although cyanide poisoning can cause AKI, a markedly elevated lactate level (eg, &gt;10 mEq/L) would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Methylene blue is the treatment for methemoglobinemia, which develops following ingestion of certain medications (eg, dapsone) or anesthetic agents.&nbsp; Methemoglobinemia can cause AGMA due to tissue hypoxia and markedly increased lactic acid production; this patient&#39;s lactic acid level is only slightly elevated, and methemoglobinemia is not expected to cause nephrolithiasis.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; N-acetylcysteine is the antidote for acetaminophen toxicity, which can cause liver failure (eg, jaundice, elevated prothrombin time) that is not present in this patient.&nbsp; Acetaminophen toxicity only rarely causes AGMA (ie, pyroglutamic acidosis); AKI and urinary oxalate crystals would not be expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which cause anion gap metabolic acidosis and organ injury (eg, acute kidney injury).&nbsp; Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase and is the preferred antidote.&nbsp; Sodium bicarbonate and hemodialysis are indicated when there is evidence of acidemia and end-organ damage.</p>",

Laboratory analysis may also reflect hemoconcentration (ie, elevated hemoglobin and leukocyte counts) due to dehydration.&nbsp; Management includes rapid cooling; evaporative techniques (eg, spraying lukewarm water while fans blow air on the patient&#39;s skin) are best tolerated in the elderly, as well as fluid resuscitation and management of end-organ complications.&nbsp;

Alcohol withdrawal can cause tachycardia and occasional fever but typically causes delirium, hallucinations, and seizures rather than syncope.&nbsp; In addition, hypertension, not hypotension, is expected, and DIC is atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; A hypothalamic stroke may disrupt normal neural thermoregulatory mechanisms and result in neurogenic fever.&nbsp; However, an expanding hypothalamic hemorrhage would likely result in herniation with Cushing triad (bradycardia, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, hypertension).&nbsp; DIC and pulmonary edema are not typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Malignant hyperthermia can cause elevated temperature, AMS, and DIC but is usually triggered by certain anesthetic agents (eg, halothane); furthermore, patients have diffuse muscular rigidity.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Severe sepsis causes fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis and may result in AMS and DIC.&nbsp; However, this patient was in his normal state of health hours prior, and although meningitis may cause a rapid decompensation, his examination does not demonstrate meningismus.&nbsp; Furthermore, temperatures &gt;40 C (104 F) are atypical, and NHS is more likely in the setting of prolonged heat exposure.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Nonexertional (classic) heat stroke most commonly affects elderly patients and is characterized by body temperature &#8805;40 C (104 F) with CNS dysfunction (eg, encephalopathy).&nbsp; Other common manifestations include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and end-organ dysfunction (eg, diffuse intravascular coagulopathy, pulmonary edema).</p>",

Most cases are caused by excessive ingestion of aspirin, although it can also be seen due to overuse of other salicylate products (eg, oil of wintergreen [methylsalicylate]).&nbsp; Toxic quantities of salicylates quickly overwhelm the ability of the liver to metabolize the compound, which prompts prolonged serum elevation of the drug due to slower renal excretion.&nbsp; Patients usually have the following manifestations:</p><ul><li><p>Nausea, vomiting, and <strong>epigastric pain</strong> due to stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla, irritation of the gastric mucosa, and reduced gastric epithelial prostaglandin production</p></li><li><p><strong>Hyperventilation</strong> due to stimulation of the respiratory center in the medulla</p></li><li><p><strong>Anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong> due to interference with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which leads to <strong>lactic acidosis</strong> (because gluconeogenesis is impaired) and <strong>hyperthermia</strong> (because byproducts of energy production are dissipated as heat)</p></li><li><p><strong>Confusion</strong> due to neuroglycopenia and cerebral edema</p></li></ul><p>Tinnitus also commonly occurs.&nbsp; The diagnosis is made with <strong>serum salicylate level</strong>.&nbsp; Treatment includes supportive therapy and activated charcoal if aspirin was ingested.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Carboxyhemoglobin level is elevated in carbon monoxide poisoning, which often presents with confusion, lactic acidosis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.&nbsp; However, patients do not typically have hyperthermia.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; CT mesenteric angiogram can diagnose acute mesenteric ischemia, which often causes severe abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and lactic acidosis.&nbsp; However, tachypnea, hyperthermia, and confusion are less common.&nbsp; In addition, most patients have a risk factor for acute embolism, such as atrial fibrillation (eg, irregular rhythm).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; CT scan of the abdomen could diagnose an abdominal abscess, which may cause abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and lactic acidosis from sepsis.&nbsp; However, it is unlikely that symptoms would progress over a few hours; several days would be more common.&nbsp; Peptic ulcer disease (sometimes noted as mucosal discontinuity on CT) can cause epigastric pain but would not cause lactic acidosis in the absence of hypotension (eg, hypoperfusion, perforation with rebound/guarding).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Dantrolene treats neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a hypermetabolic syndrome associated with some antipsychotic agents.&nbsp; Although NMS can cause hyperthermia and altered mental status, severe muscle rigidity would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; This patient&#39;s metabolic abnormalities suggest a condition outside the CNS.&nbsp; Although this patient may undergo noncontrast head CT scan due to confusion, a brain MRI is expensive, time consuming, and generally reserved for identifying cerebrovascular events, tumors, and other conditions with focal neurologic deficits.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Naloxone reverses acute opioid overdose, which can cause decreased level of consciousness but is not typically associated with hyperthermia and is generally marked by miotic pupils (eg, &lt;2 mm) and decreased respiratory rate (not tachypnea).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Salicylate toxicity is generally marked by nausea/vomiting, anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate level, hyperthermia, and tachypnea.&nbsp; Diagnosis is made with serum salicylate level.</p>",
