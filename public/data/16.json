Normally, healthy people of all ages have small amounts of gastric contents reflux into the esophagus.&nbsp; Compared to adults, infants experience frequent <strong>postprandial regurgitation</strong> (eg, <strong>&#x22;spitting up,&#x22;</strong> &#x22;spilling&#x22;) due to physiologic differences.&nbsp; These differences include a shorter esophagus, incomplete closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, and greater time spent in the supine position.&nbsp; Most infants are otherwise <strong>asymptomatic</strong> (eg, &#x22;happy spitter&#x22;), and parents should be reassured if examination, growth, and development are normal.</p><p>Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination.&nbsp; Treatment consists of education and supportive measures.&nbsp; Parents should be advised to give <strong>frequent, small-volume feeds</strong>; <strong>hold the infant upright</strong> for 20-30 minutes after feeds; and place the infant prone when awake.&nbsp; Activities that increase intraabdominal pressure (eg, fastening the diaper too tight, bringing the knees to the stomach) should be avoided.&nbsp; Regurgitation usually improves around age 6 months (when the infant can sit unsupported) and resolves by age 1 year.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and G)</strong>&nbsp; In contrast to physiologic reflux, pathologic features of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include failure to thrive (eg, poor weight gain, drop in growth percentiles) or Sandifer syndrome (intermittent opisthotonic posturing).&nbsp; Thickened feeds (eg, adding oatmeal) and antacid therapy (eg, proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) are the first steps in management of GERD.&nbsp; These interventions are unnecessary for physiologic reflux as thickened feeds can cause excessive weight gain and PPIs increase risk for pneumonia and diarrhea.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Pyloric stenosis presents with frequent projectile vomiting and is diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound.&nbsp; This patient appears well and is gaining weight, making further workup unnecessary.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Prone positioning can decrease reflux.&nbsp; However, an infant should be placed only on the back (ie, supine) during sleep as the risk of sudden infant death syndrome with prone sleeping outweighs the benefit of reflux reduction.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Regurgitation caused by milk protein allergy is associated with eczema, poor weight gain, and bloody stools and is treated by switching to a hydrolyzed formula.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Cow milk protein&ndash;based formula (which is different from cow&#39;s milk) is standard infant formula; it provides infants with necessary nutrients.&nbsp; Goat milk is deficient in folate and would result in a macrocytic anemia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Gastroesophageal reflux is common in infants due to a shorter esophagus, incomplete closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, and greater time spent in the supine position.&nbsp; Parents should be reassured by the infant&#39;s adequate weight gain and be advised to hold the infant upright after feeds.</p>",
