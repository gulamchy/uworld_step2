Evaluation of bacterial meningitis includes blood cultures and lumbar puncture (LP).&nbsp; A head CT scan should be performed prior to LP to rule out intracranial mass in patients with certain risk factors (eg, immunocompromised state, previous central nervous system disease, new-onset seizures, papilledema, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits).&nbsp; Antibiotic therapy is generally initiated after obtaining an LP and blood cultures; however, if LP must be delayed for neuroimaging, antibiotics should be started immediately after drawing blood cultures.</p><p>Empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis depends on risk factors and specific pathogens.&nbsp; In <strong>immunocompromised patients</strong> (eg, transplant recipients on immunosuppressants), the treatment of choice is cefepime or ceftazidime plus vancomycin plus ampicillin.&nbsp; <strong>Cefepime</strong> is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that covers most of the major organisms of bacterial meningitis (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, group B streptococci, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) as well as <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.&nbsp; <strong>Vancomycin</strong> provides coverage against cephalosporin-resistant pneumococci, and <strong>ampicillin</strong> covers <strong><em>Listeria monocytogenes</em></strong>.&nbsp; Patients should also empirically receive dexamethasone to help prevent the neurologic complications (eg, deafness, focal deficits) of <em>S pneumoniae</em> meningitis, but it should be discontinued once pneumococcal meningitis is ruled out.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cefepime and ampicillin would cover most organisms responsible for meningitis, including <em>Pseudomonas</em>&nbsp;and <em>Listeria</em>; however, vancomycin is also necessary in this patient to cover cephalosporin-resistant pneumococci.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and E)</strong>&nbsp; Ceftazidime (or meropenem) and vancomycin are indicated for patients with neurosurgery/shunt or penetrating trauma to the skull who have symptoms of meningitis.&nbsp; This regimen covers methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcal aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and gram-negative rods (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em>); however, it does not adequately cover <em>Listeria</em>.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Ceftriaxone alone is effective in the treatment of meningitis due to <em>H influenzae</em> or <em>N meningitidis</em>.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Empiric antibiotics must not be delayed while awaiting results of CT scan or performing lumbar puncture to diagnose bacterial meningitis.&nbsp; Cefepime plus vancomycin plus ampicillin is the regimen of choice for immunocompromised patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.&nbsp; Corticosteroids should be started at the same time as antibiotics and discontinued if cultures show an organism other than <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</p>",
