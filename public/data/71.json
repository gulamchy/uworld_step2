No associated nausea or visual symptoms (eg, photophobia) are present, the patient can perform daily activities, and the headaches have not changed from before, although they now are more frequent.&nbsp; These findings are most consistent with <strong>tension-type headaches (TTHs)</strong>.</p><p>TTHs are often described as <strong>bilateral</strong> pain that is tight or feels like <strong>pressure</strong> throughout the head (in this patient, in the temporal and occipital regions).&nbsp; <strong>Muscle tenderness</strong> of the head and neck is a common feature that can be seen on examination.&nbsp; TTHs are often short (~30 min) and episodic, but some patients can have persistent headaches lasting days to months; however, most patients can continue with daily activities.&nbsp; The headaches can become more frequent during periods of <strong>stress</strong> (eg, recent death of this patient&#39;s sister).</p><p>Patients with episodic TTHs (&#8804;10 days/month) can use <strong>simple analgesics</strong> (eg, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin), which can be combined with caffeine without concern for developing medication-overuse headaches.&nbsp; Prophylactic medication (eg, amitriptyline) for TTHs should be considered in patients with very frequent (particularly long-duration) and/or disabling headaches; patients should also be taught techniques to manage stress (eg, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Headaches associated with brain tumors usually progressively worsen, occur in the morning, and are associated with frequent nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; Seizures and/or neurologic deficits are common.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cluster headaches generally present with unilateral recurrent periorbital pain with associated ipsilateral autonomic features (eg, miosis, ptosis).&nbsp; The pain can be excruciating, and patients are often agitated.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Giant cell arteritis occurs in patients age &gt;50.&nbsp; Headaches are usually localized to the temples and frequently associated with fever, weight loss, vision changes, and jaw claudication.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Cerebral edema due to hypertensive encephalopathy can cause headaches, but the pain would be constant and associated with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, nausea, vomiting) and severe hypertension (&#8805;180/120 mm Hg).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with TTHs can have concomitant major depression, but this patient does not appear to have depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, or other prominent manifestations of depression.&nbsp; In addition, depression alone is unlikely to cause the symptoms the patient describes.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Migraines (with or without aura) are usually unilateral and pulsatile/throbbing; they are often associated with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Tension-type headaches can occur due to stress and are usually bilateral, dull, and nonthrobbing without associated symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting).&nbsp; In most cases, these headaches can be treated with simple analgesics, but prophylactic medication (eg, amitriptyline) should be considered when they are more disabling.</p>",

In the context of a normal CT scan, these findings are likely due to <strong>idiopathic intracranial hypertension</strong> (IIH).&nbsp; This condition is most commonly seen in <strong>young, obese</strong> (BMI &#8805;30 kg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>) <strong>women</strong> and is also associated with certain medications (eg, retinoids, tetracyclines, growth hormone).</p><p>Patients with IIH typically have holocranial or lateralized <strong>headache</strong>, vision changes (<strong>blurry vision</strong>, diplopia), and pulsatile tinnitus (&#x22;whooshing&#x22; sound in the ears).&nbsp; <strong>Abducens nerve (CN VI) palsy</strong> (lateral rectus palsy) is a nonlocalizing sign of high ICP and can be seen in several different conditions.</p><p>Initial evaluation of IIH includes complete ocular examination and neuroimaging to exclude secondary causes of intracranial hypertension (eg, mass, hemorrhage).&nbsp; MRI, often with venography to rule out cerebral venous thrombosis, is the preferred imaging modality; however, CT scan is generally faster and easier to obtain in emergencies.</p><p>After a space-occupying lesion is excluded, <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> can be performed safely and is indicated to document <strong>elevated opening pressure</strong> (&gt;250 mm H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>O).&nbsp; Cerebrospinal fluid studies (eg, cell counts) are normal in IIH.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that is particularly important when temporal arteritis is suspected as the cause of headache.&nbsp; Although temporal arteritis commonly presents with headache and visual symptoms, it almost never occurs in patients age &lt;50, constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) are common, and increased ICP is not seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; MR angiogram is indicated if subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is suspected.&nbsp; However, headache from SAH is classically sudden in onset (ie, thunderclap) in contrast to this patient&#39;s 3-month history.&nbsp; MR angiography is also indicated for suspected trigeminal neuralgia, but the pain is typically isolated to the face (trigeminal nerve [CN V] distribution), and elevated ICP is not seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Oral corticosteroids are indicated when headache is due to temporal arteritis, which is highly unlikely in this patient age &lt;50 with elevated ICP.&nbsp; Intravenous corticosteroids are used when neuroimaging reveals elevated ICP resulting from mass effect (eg, tumor, abscess).&nbsp; On occasion, in patients with confirmed IIH (ie, after lumbar puncture) and impending visual loss, corticosteroids can be used as bridging therapy while awaiting definitive surgical treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Oral propranolol can be used for migraine prophylaxis.&nbsp; Migraines classically cause unilateral, throbbing headaches and photophobia.&nbsp; Although this patient has a family history of migraine, her holocranial headache and optic disc edema are suggestive of IIH rather than migraine disorder.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension typically presents in young, obese women with headache, vision changes, papilledema, and sometimes abducens nerve (CN VI) palsy.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing elevated opening pressure and normal cell counts.</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p>This patient&#39;s stroke 4 weeks ago resulted in sensation deficits without motor weakness, cortical signs, or cranial nerve deficits (ie, pure sensory stroke).&nbsp; As numbness improved, she developed allodynia (burning pain) and hyperesthesia in areas impacted by the stroke (right arm and leg).&nbsp; These findings are&nbsp;likely due to the development of <strong>thalamic pain syndrome</strong>, a central neuropathic pain syndrome that can develop after a stroke impacting the thalamus (most likely a <a href=\"4625\">lacunar stroke</a>); the adjacent basal ganglia can also be impacted, resulting in athetosis (writhing movements) or ballistic movements, as in this patient.</p><p>The thalamus <a href=\"2654\">relays sensory information</a> between various subcortical areas and the somatosensory cortex.&nbsp; Thalamic pain syndrome, characterized by severe paroxysmal burning pain over affected areas, is classically exacerbated by light touch <strong>(allodynia)</strong>.&nbsp; Because they develop in stroke-impacted areas, symptoms are typically unilateral.&nbsp; Sometimes, pain is triggered by other sensory modalities (eg, sound, taste).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Stroke impacting the internal capsule typically leads to motor deficits (alone or with sensory deficits) from disruption of the corticospinal fibers in the posterior limb.&nbsp; Although possible, a pure sensory stroke very rarely originates from the internal capsule.&nbsp; In addition, central poststroke pain syndrome is not characteristic.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Brainstem strokes commonly present with crossed signs of contralateral weakness with ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits.&nbsp; Because the oculomotor nerve [CN III] is located in the midbrain, strokes in this area typically present with ipsilateral CN III palsy and contralateral hemiparesis (from damage to the cerebral peduncle).&nbsp; Ataxia is also typically present due to damage to the superior cerebellar peduncle.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Infarction of the somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus can cause sensory loss but does not typically impact the arm and leg equally due to the vascular supply relating to the <a href=\"22671\">somatotopic organization</a> of the brain.&nbsp; However, if the stroke is large enough to impact the arm and leg, it would also likely be accompanied by hemiparesis (from primary motor cortex injury) and cortical signs (eg, aphasia, visual changes, neglect).&nbsp; A central poststroke pain syndrome is not characteristic.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Putaminal hemorrhage almost always involves the adjacent internal capsule, leading to contralateral hemiparesis and hemianesthesia (from disruption of corticospinal and somatosensory fibers in the posterior limb) and <a href=\"4613\">conjugate gaze deviation</a> toward the side of the lesion (from damage to frontal eye field efferents in the anterior limb).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Lacunar stroke of the posterolateral thalamus typically presents with sudden-onset contralateral sensory loss involving all sensory modalities (ie, pure sensory stroke).&nbsp; Weeks to months later, patients can develop thalamic pain syndrome characterized by severe paroxysmal burning pain over the affected area that is exacerbated by light touch (allodynia).</p>",

they are <strong>unilateral</strong>, sometimes described as stabbing eye pain rather than a headache, and often accompanied by <strong>agitation</strong> due to the severity of the pain.&nbsp; Autonomic manifestations are almost always present; they can include symptoms similar to those of <a href=\"67712\">Horner syndrome</a> (eg, ptosis, miosis) as well as <strong>rhinorrhea</strong> and <strong>conjunctival injection</strong> with <strong>tearing</strong>.&nbsp; Vision changes are usually absent.</p><p>Cluster headache attacks often begin during sleep, peak rapidly, and last approximately 90 minutes.&nbsp; They typically occur several times daily for 6-8 weeks followed by a long period of remission (eg, months to years), as in this patient.&nbsp; Because the attacks are rapid in onset and severe, prophylactic medication (eg, verapamil) is important for management.&nbsp; An acute attack can be aborted with inhalation of <strong>100% oxygen</strong>.&nbsp; Sumatriptan can also be used to abort a cluster headache; however, due to side effects and slower onset of action, it is not the preferred first-line treatment <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Amoxicillin-clavulanate is used to treat acute paranasal sinusitis.&nbsp; This sinusitis can present with facial pain and rhinorrhea and can sometimes lead to orbital complications (eg, orbital cellulitis).&nbsp; However, pain would not occur in self-limited episodes, and patients typically also have other symptoms, including nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain, and fever rather than autonomic symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Carbamazepine is indicated for trigeminal neuralgia, which is characterized by recurrent and sudden-onset, stabbing pain along the V<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (maxillary) and V<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font> (mandibular) branches of the <a href=\"59156\">trigeminal nerve</a>.&nbsp; The episodes last a few seconds to minutes and can be triggered by minor stimuli (eg, brushing teeth).&nbsp; Ptosis, miosis, rhinorrhea, and the duration of this patient&#39;s pain are more suggestive of cluster headache.</p><p><strong>(Choices E and F)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"40288\">Angle-closure glaucoma</a> can be treated with eye-pressure lowering drops (timolol, apraclonidine, and pilocarpine) and, after attack resolution, laser peripheral iridotomy or surgical peripheral iridectomy (drainage hole through the iris).&nbsp; Although sudden-onset eye pain and redness are common, patients typically also have diminished vision with halos around lights and a fixed and mid-dilated pupil, not ptosis or a constricted pupil.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cluster headaches usually present with acute, unilateral, severe periorbital pain that awakens patients from sleep.&nbsp; These headaches are often accompanied by autonomic symptoms (eg, tearing, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis).&nbsp; The most effective abortive therapy is 100% oxygen.</p>",
