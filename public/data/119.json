<strong>Minimal to no axillary or pubic hair</strong> development occurs due to peripheral androgen resistance.</li></ul><p>AIS is diagnosed with karyotype analysis.&nbsp; Management includes prophylactic gonadectomy due to the increased risk of testicular cancer associated with cryptorchidism.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with 5-alpha reductase deficiency cannot convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and appear phenotypically female at birth.&nbsp; In contrast to AIS, this condition causes virilization at puberty (eg, clitoromegaly) without breast development (because testosterone receptors in the breast are functional and inhibit breast development).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with m&uuml;llerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome) have primary amenorrhea because they have no uterus.&nbsp; However, the ovaries are intact, so patients have otherwise normal female development (eg, pubic and axillary hair) and female-range testosterone levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are a type of sex cord&ndash;stromal ovarian tumor that produces high testosterone levels and subsequently causes virilization.&nbsp; Patients can have amenorrhea, but an adnexal mass is typically visualized on pelvic ultrasonography.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;
