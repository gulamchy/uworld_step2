In the normal state, standing from a seated or supine position triggers arterial baroreceptors to increase sympathetic drive, causing vasoconstriction (which mobilizes pooled venous blood from the legs) and an increase in heart rate (to aid cardiac output).&nbsp; NOH occurs due to <strong>autonomic dysfunction</strong> that may result from degenerative changes to autonomic ganglia or CNS nuclei; there is impaired release of norepinephrine and consequent failure of vasoconstriction and increased heart rate.</p><p>Therefore, like orthostatic hypotension from other causes, NOH leads to a drop in systolic blood pressure &#8805;20 mm Hg with standing (orthostasis); however, unlike other causes of orthostatic hypotension that occur with an intact autonomic nervous system (eg, hypovolemia), the expected <strong>increase in heart rate</strong>&nbsp;is <strong>absent</strong>.</p><p>Notably, dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson disease (eg, levodopa) may further contribute to orthostatic hypotension, possibly due to undesired peripheral activity of dopamine that stimulates vasodilation.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; Intravascular volume depletion due to primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) or other causes (eg, reduced oral intake) can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope.&nbsp; However, PAI is not an expected complication of Parkinson disease and is usually accompanied by electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia).&nbsp; In addition, an increase in heart rate is expected with orthostasis that is due to hypovolemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Carotid sinus hypersensitivity involves an exaggerated vagal response triggered by tactile stimulus of the carotid sinus.&nbsp; Patients often experience syncope with activities such as shaving or putting on a necktie.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Sinus node dysfunction commonly manifests as sick sinus syndrome, a potential cause of syncope.&nbsp; Although the heart rate response is often impaired, vascular autonomic innervation and vasoconstriction are intact, making orthostatic symptoms less prominent with sick sinus syndrome.&nbsp; In addition, suggestive ECG abnormalities (eg, sinus pauses) are commonly present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Autonomic dysfunction is common with Parkinson disease and can lead to neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, with patients experiencing lightheadedness or syncope on standing.&nbsp; The disorder is typically recognized by a &#8805;20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure with standing and an absence of the expected increase in heart rate.</p>",

In many cases, FTD involves abnormal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau protein or the 43 kD TAR (ie, transactive response) DNA-binding protein (TDP-43).&nbsp; Neuronal cell death leads to characteristic frontal and temporal lobe atrophy with resulting stereotypic personality and <strong>behavioral symptoms</strong>, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Disinhibition</strong> (eg, scratching coworkers&#39; cars)</li><li><strong>Apathy</strong> (eg, unconcerned by work deadlines, uninterested in golf)</li><li><strong>Loss of empathy</strong> (eg, impolite to wife)</li><li><strong>Compulsions or rituals</strong> (eg, putting gum on nightstand)</li><li><strong>Hyperorality</strong> (eg, incessant gum chewing)</li><li><strong>Executive dysfunction</strong> (eg, Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score 25/30)</li></ul><p>Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on having &#8805;3 of 6 behavioral symptoms.&nbsp; However, neuroimaging with either a CT scan or MRI is often performed to exclude other etiologies (eg, mass, stroke) and look for the expected focal <a href=\"51690\">white matter loss</a>.&nbsp; The prognosis is terminal within 8-10 years after disease onset, and there are no treatments to lessen disease progression.&nbsp; Management aims to reduce behavioral symptoms with both nonpharmacologic (eg, exercise, trigger avoidance, redirection) and pharmacologic (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics) options.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; In adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct, behavioral symptoms present &lt;3 months after the onset of a stressor.&nbsp; Given the intensity of the personality changes and cognitive decline (MoCA score &lt;26), this patient&#39;s symptoms are better explained by a neurodegenerative process.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; In contrast to this patient&#39;s presentation, dementia with Lewy bodies presents with early visual hallucinations in addition to parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and fluctuating cognition with variations in attention and alertness.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The timing of early-onset Alzheimer disease (age &lt;65) overlaps with that of FTD.&nbsp; However, compared to FTD, early-onset Alzheimer disease presents with greater deficits in episodic memory, visuospatial abilities, and motor skills but without early prominent behavioral symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Irritability, cognitive changes, anhedonia, and apathy can be seen in major depressive disorder; however, disinhibitions, oral fixations, ritualistic behaviors, and mounting social indiscretions are not characteristic of depression.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Vascular dementia etiologies are described as post-stroke (stroke-correlated cognitive decline) and silent (without recent stroke; progressive course with sufficient cerebrovascular explanation on history, examination, or imaging).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s history of well-controlled risk factors makes post-stroke and silent vascular etiologies less likely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Frontotemporal dementia is a type of early-onset (age 50s-60s) dementia.&nbsp; It is characterized by early and progressive personality (apathetic, nonempathetic), behavior (impulsive, compulsive), and executive function abnormalities.</p>",

These findings are consistent with <strong>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</strong> (CJD), a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.</p><p>CJD is caused by <strong>prions</strong>, the only known infectious agents that lack nucleic acids (eg, DNA, RNA).&nbsp; Prions are abnormally folded proteins that can induce similar conformational changes in other proteins, which leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic fibrils.&nbsp; This results in noninflammatory spongiform <strong>neurodegeneration</strong> with <strong>widespread loss of neurons</strong> throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum.&nbsp; Head CT is often normal, especially early in the disease course.&nbsp; MRI is more sensitive and often shows hyperintensity in the cortex, caudate, and anterior putamen early, with evidence of generalized atrophy and ventricular dilatation becoming more apparent as the disease progresses.</p><p>CJD is most commonly sporadic, but it can be hereditary, iatrogenic (due to contaminated transplants or surgical instruments), or due to oral consumption of contaminated neural tissue.&nbsp; Although CJD has a long incubation period (estimated mean of 10 years), once symptoms occur, patients experience an <strong>inexorable decline</strong> (eg, loss of speech, loss of ability for self-care, coma) until <strong>death</strong>, which occurs <strong>less than 12 months after diagnosis</strong>.&nbsp; Only supportive treatment is available, which should include symptom-based management, compassionate education, and referral to social services.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Severe hypothyroidism can present with rapidly worsening cognitive decline and can be rapidly improved with thyroid hormone supplementation.&nbsp; However, dementia due to hypothyroidism is usually accompanied by fatigue, cold intolerance, and constipation.&nbsp; Upper motor neuron signs, startle-induced myoclonus, and periodic sharp waves on an EEG make CJD much more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Symptoms resulting from normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) rapidly improve after surgical restoration of cerebrospinal fluid drainage (eg, ventricular shunt).&nbsp; Although NPH can cause significant cognitive impairment and gait disturbance (and in some cases hyperreflexia and spasticity), it also classically causes urinary incontinence and ventricular enlargement on CT scan and would not explain the patient&#39;s EEG findings.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Although cholinesterase inhibitors can improve mental functioning in Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia, patients progressively worsen despite therapy.&nbsp; In contrast to CJD, Alzheimer disease has a more gradual onset of cognitive dysfunction (years vs months).&nbsp; In addition, myoclonus, upper motor neuron signs, and EEG periodic sharp waves are more characteristic of CJD.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Depression-related cognitive impairment (ie, pseudodementia) refers to cognitive changes associated with major depressive disorder, and these changes often slowly improve with pharmacotherapy.&nbsp; However, this patient does not meet the criteria for <a href=\"17482\">major depressive disorder</a>.&nbsp; In addition, myoclonus and upper motor neuron signs make CJD more likely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a fatal prion disease that presents with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, mood changes, and sleep disturbances.&nbsp; There is no effective disease-modifying treatment.&nbsp; Patients rapidly decline until death, which occurs less than 12 months after diagnosis.</p>",
