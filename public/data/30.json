Both CD and UC present with <strong>chronic diarrhea</strong>, <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, <strong>anemia</strong>, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate).&nbsp; Although not universally true, pain is predominant in CD, whereas hematochezia is more common in UC.&nbsp; Severe manifestations of CD include fistulas, strictures, and abscesses; uncontrolled UC can lead to toxic megacolon.</p><p>Diagnosing IBD and distinguishing between CD and UC requires <strong>colonoscopy with biopsies</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>CD</strong> is characterized grossly by a cobblestone appearance, <strong>skip lesions</strong> (eg, areas of normal-appearing bowel between inflamed segments), and deep serpiginous ulcers.&nbsp; On the other hand, <strong>UC</strong> demonstrates <strong>continuous</strong>, shallow ulcerations and pseudopolyps.&nbsp; On histology, chronic inflammation in <strong>CD</strong> extends beyond the submucosa and is often <strong>transmural</strong>; noncaseating granulomas may be present.&nbsp; In UC, inflammation is usually limited to the mucosa, although it occasionally extends into the submucosa.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Fecal calprotectin, a stool marker for inflammatory diarrhea, is typically elevated in patients with IBD. &nbsp;However, it is not specific for IBD and is not used to make the initial diagnosis of IBD; it is sometimes used in patients with established CD who have symptoms of a flare. &nbsp;An elevated fecal calprotectin would not distinguish between CD and UC.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and G)</strong>&nbsp; Tissue transglutaminase is a marker of celiac disease, whereas loperamide and the low FODMAP (<strong>F</strong>ermentable <strong>O</strong>ligosaccharides, <strong>D</strong>isaccharides, <strong>M</strong>onosaccharides, <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>P</strong>olyols) diet represent initial steps in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&nbsp; Neither celiac disease nor IBS presents with an elevated C-reactive protein or bloody stool on rectal examination.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; A barium enema can be used to characterize colonic inflammation; however, it is less accurate than a colonoscopy for diagnosing IBD.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; CT findings (eg, fat stranding, intestinal wall thickening) in IBD are identical to those of other types of colitis (eg, infectious, ischemic) and are therefore too nonspecific to be used for initial diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Azithromycin is used to treat travelers&#39; diarrhea, which causes abdominal cramps and self-limited watery or bloody diarrhea.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s travel history is too remote to be related to his clinical presentation; travelers&#39; diarrhea typically presents within 2 weeks of initial infection.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers.&nbsp; Colonoscopy with biopsies is the test of choice for diagnosis because it can distinguish between characteristic findings of Crohn disease (eg, cobblestone appearance, skip lesions, deep ulcerations, transmural inflammation, granulomas) and those of ulcerative colitis (eg, continuous, shallow ulcerations limited to the mucosa/submucosa, pseudopolyps).</p>",
