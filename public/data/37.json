            "explanationText": "<p>This patient&#39;s clinical presentation &ndash; abrupt onset of regular tachycardia that resolves with cold-water immersion &ndash; is consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).&nbsp; <strong>Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia</strong> (AVNRT) is the most common form of PSVT and frequently develops in young patients with a structurally normal heart.&nbsp; Palpitations are the most common presentation, but some patients may have dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.</p><p>AVNRT is due to the presence of 2 conduction pathways (slow and fast) in the AV node.&nbsp; Normally, sinus beats are conducted in an antegrade direction through the fast pathway, as antegrade conduction through the slow pathway is extinguished due to the presence of a refractory period.&nbsp; If an atrial premature beat occurs at a critical time when the fast pathway is refractory but the slow pathway is not, it can initiate AVNRT that is then sustained by a <strong>reentry mechanism</strong>: the slow and the fast pathways form a looped circuit, with impulses traveling in an antegrade direction through the slow pathway and returning through the fast pathway.</p><p><strong>Vagal maneuvers</strong> (eg, carotid sinus massage, cold-water immersion or diving reflex, Valsalva maneuver, eyeball pressure) increase <strong>parasympathetic</strong> tone in the heart and result in a temporary slowing of conduction in the <strong>AV node</strong> and an increase in the AV node <strong>refractory period</strong>, leading to termination of AVNRT.</p><p><strong>(Choices B, E, and F)</strong>&nbsp; Vagal stimulation has minimal effect on the His-Purkinje system conduction or myocardial contractility.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Purkinje fibers and the myocardium are not involved in the reentrant pathway responsible for initiation of AVNRT.&nbsp; Increased parasympathetic activity increases peripheral vascular capacitance and decreases venous return to the heart, but this decreased venous return does not directly affect the AV node.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although vagal maneuvers decrease sinoatrial (SA) node automaticity and cause slowing of the rate of impulse formation from the sinus node, AVNRT termination is due to effects on the reentrant mechanism in the AV node rather than to changes in SA node automaticity (as the SA node is not part of the reentrant pathway).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Cold-water immersion can increase vascular tone by causing vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the face; however, this is not the underlying mechanism responsible for termination of PSVT.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and is caused by a reentry mechanism due to the presence of a dual electrical pathway (slow and fast pathway) in the AV node.&nbsp; Vagal maneuvers increase parasympathetic tone and result in a temporary slowing of conduction in the AV node and an increase in the AV node refractory period, leading to termination of AVNRT.</p>",

The distance between the start of each P wave is constant (constant P-P interval); therefore, as the PR interval prolongs the R-R interval progressively decreases.&nbsp; ECG often demonstrates <strong>grouped beating</strong>, which is repetitive grouping of QRS complexes (eg, drop occurs after every 3 QRS complexes).</p><p>The block usually is located within the AV node, and causes include elevated vagal tone (eg, highly trained athletes), excessive pharmacologic AV nodal blockade (eg, beta blockers), ischemia, and age-related degeneration of the conduction system.&nbsp; Patients usually are asymptomatic, and management involves only <strong>observation</strong> and correction of potential reversible causes (eg, reduction of pharmacologic AV nodal blockade).</p><p>In contrast, Mobitz type II second-degree AV block usually involves a block in the His-Purkinje system below the AV node.&nbsp; It is recognized on <a href=\"43353\">ECG</a> by a constant PR interval with randomly dropped QRS complexes <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.&nbsp; Patients can be asymptomatic or symptomatic (eg, fatigue, lightheadedness, syncope).&nbsp; Regardless of whether symptoms are present, the arrhythmia can progress to complete AV block and placement of a permanent pacemaker usually is necessary.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; In <a href=\"8818\">atrial fibrillation</a>, there is no organized atrial activity, and impulses are conducted in a random and unpredictable manner.&nbsp; This leads to an absence of discernible P waves and an irregularly irregular rhythm with varying R-R intervals.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"42466\">Complete (third-degree) AV block</a> involves complete failure of impulse conduction from the atria to the ventricles.&nbsp; On ECG, P waves are entirely unrelated to QRS complexes and can be found before, after, or even buried in the QRS complexes.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"59285\">First-degree AV block</a> is due to delayed impulse transmission from the atria to the ventricles, leading to a prolonged PR interval (&gt;0.20 sec).&nbsp; The PR interval remains constant, and a QRS complex follows every P wave.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Mobitz type I atrioventricular (AV) block is recognized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex.&nbsp; The block typically is located within the AV node.&nbsp; In contrast, Mobitz type II AV block usually is located in the His-Purkinje system.&nbsp; Patients with Mobitz type I AV block usually are asymptomatic, and management involves observation and correction of reversible causes.</p>",

Syncope occurs due to global hypoperfusion of the brain and can have many causes.&nbsp; In most cases, syncope is benign and self-limiting; however, it can be the initial manifestation of a life-threatening disease process (eg, cardiac syncope).</p><p>A detailed initial evaluation can provide several clues to the underlying etiology.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s syncopal episode had <strong>no obvious trigger or prodrome</strong> to implicate reflex syncope; it also did not occur with position change (ie, standing from a seated position) to suggest orthostatic syncope.&nbsp; Instead, the syncopal episode occurred with the patient <strong>at rest</strong> and <strong>without warning symptoms</strong>.&nbsp; This presentation raises concern for a <strong>cardiac etiology</strong>, specifically an <strong>arrhythmic</strong> etiology, and should prompt further cardiac evaluation <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Continuous ECG monitoring</strong> can evaluate for transient arrhythmia (eg, <strong>ventricular tachycardia</strong>) that may not be detected on initial ECG.&nbsp; In relatively young patients (eg, age &lt;40) without structural heart disease, ambulatory ECG monitoring (eg, Holter monitor, insertable cardiac monitor) is usually appropriate.&nbsp; In contrast, patients likely need hospital admission for closer monitoring and expedited cardiac evaluation when they are older, have underlying structural heart disease (eg, prior myocardial infarction), or have an abnormal ECG.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; CT angiography of the chest can evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE), which sometimes presents with syncope.&nbsp; However, other symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea) or signs (eg, hypoxemia, tachycardia) are usually present, and PE is unlikely to account for recurrent episodes of syncope.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Seizure activity (diagnosed on electroencephalography) can cause LOC with jerking movements; however, other suggestive features (eg, prodromal aura, postictal period) are typically present.&nbsp; Muscle jerks can occur in all types of syncope because sudden cerebral hypoperfusion often causes brief myoclonus.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Noncontrast CT scan of the head helps rule out trauma-induced intracranial injury (eg, hemorrhage).&nbsp; It is not indicated in this patient who experienced a relatively low-impact mechanism of injury and has no abnormal neurologic symptoms or findings 2 days after the incident.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with syncope not clearly attributable to a benign etiology (eg, reflex or orthostatic syncope) should undergo further cardiac workup (eg, ambulatory ECG) to determine whether a cardiac etiology is present.&nbsp; Syncope that occurs while supine or sitting, at rest, and without warning symptoms suggests an arrhythmic etiology.</p>",

Given the patient&#39;s history of paroxysmal <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong> (AF) and irregular pulse on examination, the most likely cause is embolism of a left atrial thrombus, which might have been prevented by appropriate anticoagulation therapy.</p><p>Current guidelines recommend the use of the CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-VASc score for <strong>thromboembolic risk</strong> assessment in patients with AF.&nbsp; Men with a <strong>CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-VASc score &#8805;2</strong>, such as this patient (score = 3: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, age 65-74), and women with a score &#8805;3 are at high risk of thromboembolic events and should be managed with <a href=\"1232\">anticoagulation therapy</a>.&nbsp; In these patients, the benefit of lowered embolization risk outweighs the risk of bleeding (eg, intracranial hemorrhage).</p><p><strong>Apixaban</strong> is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that <a href=\"672\">directly inhibits factor Xa</a>, preventing it from cleaving prothrombin to thrombin.&nbsp; The DOACs, including direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (eg, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban), significantly <strong>reduce systemic embolization risk</strong> with similar or superior efficacy to warfarin but with decreased risk of severe bleeding (eg, hemorrhagic stroke) and no need for routine INR testing.&nbsp; In contrast, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is significantly less effective in reducing thromboembolic risk compared with anticoagulant therapy with a DOAC or warfarin <strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor occasionally used for symptomatic management of patients with intermittent claudication, which typically presents more chronically with exertional leg pain.&nbsp; Although cilostazol also suppresses platelet aggregation, it is not indicated for primary thromboembolic event prevention in patients with AF.</p><p><strong>(Choices E and F)</strong>&nbsp; Calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem) and beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) are used for heart rate control in patients with AF.&nbsp; Rate control helps manage symptoms and avoid hemodynamic instability from rapid ventricular response; however, unlike anticoagulation, it does not prevent thromboembolic events.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>An anticoagulation agent, such as a direct oral anticoagulant (eg, apixaban) or warfarin, should be used to reduce the risk of systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of thromboembolic events (ie, CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-VASc score &#8805;2 for men and &#8805;3 for women).</p>",

The <a href=\"19605\">systolic murmur</a> characteristic of HCM is <strong>sometimes absent</strong> because left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction may be absent or only present with exertion.&nbsp; ECG is usually abnormal and may show left axis deviation or disruptions in depolarization (eg, prominent Q waves) or repolarization (eg, T-wave inversions).</p><p><strong>Syncope</strong> due to HCM is <strong>usually exertional</strong> and typically results from one of the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Reduced cardiac output</strong> due to dynamic <strong>LVOT obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Exertion-related factors (eg, dehydration, reduced LV filling time) lead to low LV blood volume, which can exacerbate the obstruction and markedly reduce cardiac output.&nbsp; This mechanism likely explains this patient&#39;s episodes of exertional lightheadedness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia</strong>:&nbsp; HCM causes increased myocardial O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> demand (increased muscle mass) and reduced myocardial O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> supply (myocardial disarray with microvascular dysfunction), even at rest.&nbsp; Intense exertion amplifies this <strong>O</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font>&nbsp;<strong>supply-demand mismatch</strong> and can trigger ventricular arrhythmias; LVOT obstruction (causing reduced O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> supply) can further exacerbate this mechanism.&nbsp; Ventricular arrhythmia that does not terminate (as it does with syncope) is the typical cause of sudden cardiac death in HCM.</p></li></ul><p>HCM is diagnosed with <strong>echocardiography</strong>, which can demonstrate asymmetric LV hypertrophy primarily affecting the interventricular septum, dynamic LVOT obstruction, LV diastolic dysfunction, and left atrial dilation.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Ambulatory ECG monitoring is helpful in diagnosing intermittent arrhythmias and could detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in patients with HCM.&nbsp; However, echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Coronary angiography is used to diagnose atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, which is unlikely in this young patient.&nbsp; In patients with HCM, the epicardial coronary arteries are normal; microvascular disease that is often present is not detectable by coronary angiography.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Syncope due to acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is not typically exertional.&nbsp; In addition, PE is unlikely in this patient with normal heart rate and oxygen saturation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Reassurance and routine follow-up is not appropriate because unmanaged HCM puts this patient at increased risk for sudden cardiac death.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Physical examination is frequently normal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).&nbsp; Patients with suspected HCM (eg, exertional syncope and abnormal ECG) should undergo echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

The pathophysiology of AF involves aging and comorbidities (eg, hypertension, heart failure) that cause atrial remodeling and create an <a href=\"46410\">underlying substrate</a> for AF to develop.&nbsp; The substrate creates a lower threshold for <strong>triggers</strong> (eg, binge alcohol intake, hyperthyroidism) to <strong>initiate and sustain</strong> AF; however, sometimes triggers can cause AF in the absence of underlying substrate.&nbsp; After a first episode of AF, patients with risk factors for underlying substrate typically develop recurrent (ie, paroxysmal) or permanent AF.</p><p>In contrast, patients <strong>without risk factors for underlying substrate</strong> (eg, age &lt;50, no significant medical history) are relatively unlikely to experience recurrent AF, especially when the trigger of the episode is removed (eg, cessation of binge alcohol intake, treatment of hyperthyroidism).&nbsp; This is at least part of the reason these patients have <strong>low thromboembolic risk</strong> associated with AF.&nbsp; They often have a <strong>CHA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>DS<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-Vasc score of 0</strong>, as in this patient, for which chronic anticoagulation is not indicated.&nbsp;

Amiodarone is used occasionally for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent, symptomatic episodes of AF (ie, rhythm-control strategy).&nbsp; This patient has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm, and amiodarone is not indicated.&nbsp; First-line rate control agents (eg, metoprolol) are commonly used but are not needed in patients with relatively low likelihood of recurrent AF.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has shown some benefit in lowering the thromboembolic risk in patients with AF.&nbsp; However, the therapy is rarely used as anticoagulant agents (eg, rivaroxaban, warfarin) provide greater benefit with roughly the same level of increase in bleeding risk.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients without underlying risk factors who develop atrial fibrillation typically have low associated thromboembolic risk.&nbsp;
