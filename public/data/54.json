In patients with <strong>structural airway disease</strong> (eg, <strong>asthma</strong>, <strong>CF</strong>), recurrent infections and mucus trapping lead to chronic <strong>colonization</strong> and hypersensitization to <strong>fungus spores</strong> (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em>).&nbsp; This promotes a Th2-based allergic response, driving <strong>production of IgE</strong> and eosinophilia.</p><p>ABPA may be indistinguishable from underlying CF bronchopneumonia.&nbsp; Fever, malaise, and thick, blood-streaked sputum are common.&nbsp; ABPA must be suspected if there is an unexplained lung function decline <strong>despite an appropriate antibiotic course</strong> (&gt;1 wk).&nbsp; Diagnosis includes evidence of <em>Aspergillus</em>-specific sensitization (eg, positive skin testing, specific IgE) and chest radiology showing bronchiectasis and mucus plugging (eg, intrabronchial exudates appearing as tubular, finger-in-glove radiodensities).&nbsp; In patients with CF, routine annual ABPA screening with total serum IgE is recommended.</p><p>Treatment includes systemic <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> to <strong>decrease allergic inflammation</strong> and antifungal therapy (eg, voriconazole) to reduce spore burden.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can cause constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise) and necrotizing bronchiectasis, mimicking infectious pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; However, it typically affects older men and is not associated with elevated IgE or eosinophilia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis can cause fever, malaise, and pneumonia-like airspace infiltrates unresponsive to antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Pneumonitis typically improves spontaneously in the hospital (patient removed from inciting exposure).&nbsp; Eosinophilia and high IgE are not expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Simple (nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis is a helminthic infection that can cause eosinophilic pulmonary disease (ie, infiltrates with peripheral eosinophilia) and elevated IgE.&nbsp; However, it usually occurs in rural tropical and subtropical areas; in addition, because larvae penetrate the skin and are eventually swallowed, patients usually also have dermatologic (roaming urticaria) and gastrointestinal (obstruction, ileus) manifestations.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with CF bronchiectasis can be colonized and infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (not <em>M tuberculosis</em>).&nbsp; However, NTM disease is chronic (months to years) and presents with nodular, cavitary, and, eventually, fibrotic lung disease.&nbsp; Eosinophilia and elevated IgE are not characteristic.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with structural airway disease, especially cystic fibrosis and asthma, are susceptible to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).&nbsp; Allergic sensitization to <em>Aspergillus</em> spores is signified by high levels of circulating IgE.&nbsp; ABPA must be suspected when lung function declines without explanation, or persistent lower respiratory infection symptoms occur despite adequate antibiotic therapy.</p>",

However, if bacteria persistently cross from the infected pulmonary parenchyma into the pleural space, a complicated parapneumonic effusion or an empyema can develop.&nbsp; Both empyemas and <strong>complicated</strong> parapneumonic effusions are marked by <strong>large</strong>, (often) loculated effusions and typical thoracentesis abnormalities (low pH, low glucose); unlike complicated parapneumonic effusions, <strong>empyemas</strong> also have frank <strong>pus</strong> or <strong>bacteria</strong> (by Gram stain) in the pleural space.</p><p>This patient likely has pneumonia (fever, productive cough), and the presence of <strong>pleuritic chest pain</strong> and a <strong>large</strong> left-sided <a href=\"46594\">pleural effusion</a> suggests the pneumonia is likely complicated by an <strong>empyema</strong>.&nbsp; Risk for pneumonia complications such as empyema is greater in patients who are immunocompromised (eg, <strong>HIV</strong>, post-transplant).&nbsp; All empyemas (and many complicated parapneumonic effusions) require prolonged antibiotics (2-4 weeks) and drainage (usually with a chest tube).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and G)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pericarditis presents with sharp, anterior chest pain.&nbsp; Viral myocarditis can cause chest pain and could be associated with upper respiratory symptoms.&nbsp; However, a cough productive of green phlegm would be unusual, and chest x-ray is typically normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchopleural fistulas often occur with malignancy or trauma, or after surgical procedures involving the bronchi (eg, pneumonectomy).&nbsp; They can cause empyemas, but there is usually radiographic evidence of air in the pleural space as well.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; A lung abscess is marked by a <a href=\"1598\">cavity</a> with air fluid level on chest x-ray.&nbsp; Aspiration pneumonia commonly causes lung abscesses and is frequently associated with foul-smelling sputum and symptoms that develop over days or weeks.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia is common in patients with HIV with a CD4 count &lt;200/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>.&nbsp; Symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever) typically arise over several weeks.&nbsp; Chest x-ray can be normal but often reveals diffuse bilateral <a href=\"46595\">interstitial or alveolar infiltrates</a>, not a large, unilateral effusion.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Pneumothorax typically presents with sudden pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.&nbsp; Chest x-ray reveals a <a href=\"5087\">radiolucent (black) region</a> of extrapulmonary air.&nbsp; This patient has fever and upper respiratory symptoms that developed over days (and an effusion).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Bacterial pneumonia commonly causes a pleural effusion.&nbsp; Often the effusion is small, sterile, and resolves with antibiotics (uncomplicated).&nbsp; However, if bacteria persistently cross into the pleural space, a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema can develop.&nbsp; Empyemas have frank pus or bacteria (by Gram stain) in the pleural space and require drainage (chest tube) in addition to prolonged antibiotics.</p>",

Bronchiectasis is associated with a number of underlying etiologies, and its development requires an <strong>infectious insult</strong> in combination with <strong>impaired bacterial clearance</strong> (eg, immunodeficiency, structural airway defect).</p><p>In this young patient, the underlying etiology of bronchiectasis is most likely undiagnosed <strong>cystic fibrosis (CF)</strong>.&nbsp; Approximately 7% of patients with CF are diagnosed at age <u>&gt;</u>18, and testing for CF is recommended in the evaluation of bronchiectasis.&nbsp; A mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene results in <strong>defective chloride and sodium transport</strong> and leads to thick secretions and <strong>impaired mucociliary clearance</strong>.&nbsp; Chronic bacterial infection ensues, leading to enhanced neutrophil recruitment and excessive release of <strong>elastase</strong>, which contributes to bronchial airway damage.&nbsp; <strong><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong> is a characteristic finding in the sputum.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>upper lung lobe</strong> involvement (evidenced by upper lung field crackles and right upper lobe infiltrate in this patient) is characteristic of bronchiectasis due to CF and helps differentiate it from bronchiectasis due to other causes.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; As in CF, excessive elastase activity also causes lung damage in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.&nbsp; Bronchiectasis can occur, but emphysema that is predominant in the lower lobes is the typical disease manifestation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Complement deficiency causes susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria and likely creates a predisposition for bronchiectasis.&nbsp; However, a childhood history of recurrent infection (eg, meningitis, pneumonia) would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Disorders of cell-mediated immunity (eg, DiGeorge syndrome, HIV) likely cause a predisposition for bronchiectasis.&nbsp; However, a history of opportunistic infections (eg, <em>Candida, Pneumocystis jirovecii)</em> would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Disorders of impaired neutrophil migration (eg, leukocyte adhesion deficiency) are not associated with bronchiectasis as enhanced tissue infiltration by neutrophils likely plays an important role in the development of bronchiectasis.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Splenic dysfunction occurs in sickle-cell anemia and results in increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria, which likely creates a predisposition for bronchiectasis.&nbsp; There is no suggestion of splenic dysfunction (eg, history of pain crises, splenectomy) in this patient.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Impaired immune defense contributes to the development of bronchiectasis.&nbsp; Impaired mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis typically leads to bronchiectasis located predominantly in the upper lobe.</p>",

Although recurrent CAP can be triggered by a variety of underlying conditions (eg, bronchial obstruction, immunodeficiency), this patient most likely has recurrent <strong>bacterial aspiration pneumonia</strong> due to the following clinical features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The lobe involved:</strong>&nbsp; Aspiration typically introduces microbes into the <strong>dependent portions</strong> of the lungs.&nbsp; Aspiration events that occur while the patient is upright usually affect the lower lobes, and those that occur when the patient is recumbent (eg, <strong>bed-bound</strong>) usually affect the superior portions of the lower lobes or <strong>posterior portions of the upper lobes</strong>.&nbsp; Therefore, recurrent aspiration pneumonia may occur in the same lobe or <strong>different lobes</strong> depending on the position of the patient during aspiration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced dementia:</strong>&nbsp; Patients with advanced dementia often have trouble coordinating the muscles involved in swallowing.&nbsp; This frequently results in <strong>pharyngeal dysphagia</strong>, which may cause aspiration due to insufficient closure of the airway during swallowing.</p></li></ul><p>Patients with bacterial aspiration pneumonia usually present <strong>several days</strong> after the aspiration event with fever, dyspnea, and cough productive of putrid sputum.&nbsp; Hypoxia and leukocytosis are common.&nbsp; Although aspiration pneumonia was previously thought to frequently involve anaerobic bacteria, more recent data indicate that anaerobes are present in a small minority of cases.&nbsp; Therefore, empiric treatment is geared towards aerobic upper respiratory organisms; when no empyema or lung abscess are present, treatment of aspiration pneumonia is the same as for community-acquired pneumonia (eg, ceftriaxone plus azithromycin).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Smokers and patients with cystic fibrosis have impaired mucociliary clearance, which increases their risk for pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis.&nbsp; However, this patient has no smoking history; given her dementia, recurrent bacterial aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of her recurrent CAP.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Increased gastric residual volume is seen in gastroparesis (eg, diabetes).&nbsp; Although this condition can increase risk of aspiration due to dysregulation of the lower esophageal sphincter, patients generally have symptoms of impaired gastric emptying such as increased satiety, bloating, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Recent antibiotic exposure can increase risk of infection with drug-resistant pathogens.&nbsp; However, in this patient with dementia, aspiration is far more likely to be the primary cause of recurrent pneumonia than colonization with drug-resistant pathogens.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Reduced salivation can be seen in Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, which is more common in older adults.&nbsp; Although this condition can cause dysphagia due to difficulty forming lubricated food boluses, most patients have a history of dry mouth and dry eyes.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Advanced dementia increases the risk of recurrent bacterial aspiration pneumonia due to impaired coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing.&nbsp; The dependent portions of the lungs are generally involved.</p>",
