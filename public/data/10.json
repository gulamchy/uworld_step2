Celiac disease is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity to gluten that leads to impaired nutrient absorption in the proximal small intestine.</p><p>Classic symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and/or <strong>weight loss</strong>.&nbsp; However, <strong>extraintestinal symptoms</strong> with <strong>no gastrointestinal features</strong> may be the sole presentation, as seen in this patient.&nbsp; For example, poor iron absorption secondary to duodenal villous atrophy can lead to <strong>iron deficiency anemia</strong> (microcytosis, &#8595; ferritin) and symptoms of fatigue or pallor.&nbsp; <a href=\"39355\">Dermatitis herpetiformis</a> is another extraintestinal manifestation and presents as <strong>grouped pruritic papules or vesicles</strong> (eg, fluid-filled) typically on <strong>extensor surfaces</strong> (eg, elbows, knees).&nbsp; Erosions and excoriations due to pruritus may be observed.</p><p>Celiac disease can be diagnosed by elevated <strong>tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody levels</strong> and duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia.&nbsp; Symptoms typically respond to a gluten-free diet; dapsone should also be given for acute management of dermatitis herpetiformis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic lupus erythematosus, in which antinuclear antibodies are positive, can cause weight loss, fatigue, photosensitivity, and a malar rash.&nbsp; A vesicular rash on the extensor surfaces would not be expected, and normocytic, not microcytic, anemia due to chronic disease is typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Streptococcal infection (eg, pharyngitis), which increases antistreptolysin O antibodies, can be associated with erythema nodosum.&nbsp; Unlike findings in celiac disease, findings in streptococcal infection include painful, nonpruritic nodules on the shins.&nbsp; It would not typically cause microcytic anemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Histologic changes in celiac disease are found in the proximal small bowel, warranting upper endoscopy, not colonoscopy.&nbsp; In addition, although this patient has microcytic anemia, his negative fecal occult blood test makes occult lower gastrointestinal tract pathology less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Dermatologic findings in hepatitis C include lichen planus (purple, polygonal, pruritic, papular lesions) and porphyria cutanea tarda, a pruritic, blistering rash on sun-exposed areas (eg, hands, face).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s rash distribution and morphology make these diagnoses unlikely.&nbsp; Furthermore, iron deficiency anemia would not be expected with hepatitis C infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Lead poisoning can cause weight loss and fatigue and can be associated with iron deficiency anemia.&nbsp; However, lead poisoning does not cause a rash and is uncommon beyond early childhood.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Celiac disease may present without overt gastrointestinal symptoms.&nbsp; Extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a papulovesicular rash on extensor surfaces.&nbsp; The diagnosis is supported by elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody levels.</p>",
