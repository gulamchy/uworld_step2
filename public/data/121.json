            "explanationText": "<p>This patient has had &#8805;3 consecutive pregnancy losses (ie, spontaneous abortions) consistent with <strong>recurrent pregnancy loss</strong>.&nbsp; Initial work-up for these patients includes pelvic ultrasound, karyotype, and testing for antiphospholipid syndrome because anatomic, genetic, and thrombotic disorders are the most common causes.</p><p>This patient&#39;s recurrent pregnancy loss is likely due to her <strong>submucosal fibroid</strong>, a benign smooth muscle (myometrial) tumor that can cause <strong>abnormal intrauterine anatomy</strong> by extending into the cavity or impinging on (ie, disrupting) the endometrium.&nbsp; This <strong>compromises embryo implantation or growth</strong>, likely due to decreased endometrial thickness and the reduced vascularity of the fibroid (relative to the myometrium).</p><p>Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss due to submucosal fibroids is <strong>hysteroscopic myomectomy</strong> (even if the fibroids do not cause heavy menses).&nbsp; This procedure restores normal intrauterine anatomy, thereby reducing the risk for future pregnancy loss.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat ovulatory infertility by increasing FSH levels and promoting ovarian follicular development.&nbsp; It is not used to treat recurrent pregnancy loss and has antiestrogen effects that decrease endometrial thickness.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Low-molecular-weight heparin is used in women with recurrent pregnancy loss due to antiphospholipid syndrome; it does not improve live birth rates in women with a negative work-up, such as this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Semen analysis of the male partner is appropriate in the initial evaluation of infertility; it is not indicated in the evaluation or treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"62704\">Uterine artery embolization</a> decreases blood flow to the uterus, thereby reducing fibroid size.&nbsp; It is not recommended for patients desiring future fertility because the resultant decreased uterine perfusion increases the risk for obstetric complications (eg, fetal growth restriction) and decreases live birth rates.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Vaginal progesterone is offered to patients with an incidental shortened cervix (&#8804;25 mm) on ultrasound or a prior history of cervical insufficiency because it may decrease the risk for preterm delivery.&nbsp; It does not reduce the risk for recurrent pregnancy loss.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Recurrent pregnancy loss (&#8805;3 consecutive pregnancy losses) may be caused by submucosal fibroids due to impaired embryo implantation or growth.&nbsp; It is managed with hysteroscopic myomectomy, which restores normal intrauterine anatomy and reduces the risk for future pregnancy loss.</p>",
