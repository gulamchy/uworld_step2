Most toddlers take their first steps between age 12 and 15 months and by <strong>18 months</strong> are <strong>walking independently with ease.&nbsp; Scribbling</strong> is a normal fine motor skill at age 18 months, and typical language milestones include a vocabulary of <strong>&#8805;3 words</strong> (in addition to &#x22;mama&#x22; and &#x22;dada&#x22;) with frequent jargon (ie, unintelligible gibberish).</p><p>This patient&#39;s language development and articulation are appropriate; most language is understood only by family members at this age, and 2-word phrases are not expected until age 24 months <strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>.&nbsp; However, he is still unable to walk without support and thus has <strong>gross motor delay (Choice F)</strong>.</p><p>Mild delays may be benign, and some toddlers catch up on skills in the subsequent few months, but early initiation of therapy (eg, physical therapy) results in improved and more rapid acquisition of skills.&nbsp; Gross motor delay could also be the first sign of a neuromuscular disorder (eg, cerebral palsy), in which early detection and treatment are essential to optimize function.&nbsp; Therefore, once developmental delays are recognized, infants and toddlers (age &lt;3) should be referred for early intervention services for in-depth developmental evaluation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Impaired social interaction, a red flag for autism spectrum disorder, is not evident in this patient.&nbsp; He demonstrates normal social interaction with his mother and appropriate stranger anxiety, which can begin as early as age 6-9 months and last until age 2 years.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; This patient follows a 1-step command without a gesture (ie, gives crayon to mother when she asks for it) consistent with normal cognitive development at age 18 months.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Normal development of an 18-month-old toddler includes speaking &#8805;3 words, walking independently, scribbling, and following a simple command.&nbsp; The inability to walk without support by this age is a sign of gross motor delay.</p>",

&#x22;dada&#x22;) by age 12 months.&nbsp; By <strong>age 2</strong>, children should be able to form <strong>2-word phrases</strong>, and by age 2.5, they should say &#8805;50 words (although many can say over 200).&nbsp; In addition, a stranger should be able to <strong>understand half of the child&#39;s speech</strong> at age 2.&nbsp; Children age 2-3 are also in the process of learning pronouns and will frequently misuse &#x22;me&#x22; instead of &#x22;I.&#x22;</p><p>By age 2, children can also run, throw a ball overhand, and kick a ball.&nbsp; They should be able to copy a straight line when drawing and use a spoon to eat.&nbsp; Children at this age often show defiance as they become more independent and confident with new skills.&nbsp; Two-year-old children commonly engage in parallel play (as seen in this child who plays alongside his sister) rather than cooperative play, in which children play together (typically age &#8805;3).</p><p>This patient is <strong>developmentally appropriate</strong> for his age.&nbsp; Although his twin sister is more vocal and has precocious language development (eg, 3-word sentences), this patient uses 2-word phrases as expected for his age and has no signs of language delay <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Autism spectrum disorder usually presents by age 2 with poor social communication (eg, limited language and eye contact, solitary play) and repetitive behaviors (eg, hand flapping).&nbsp; This patient demonstrates eye contact with his mother as well as shared attention (showing his mother his toy).&nbsp; His language development and intermittent defiance are age appropriate.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; By age 2, children should be able to sort and match objects and understand the use of familiar objects.&nbsp; This patient plays with a truck appropriately and imitates typical truck noises, consistent with appropriate cognitive development.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Audiologic testing should be performed in all children with language delay to assess for underlying hearing loss.&nbsp; Conductive hearing loss is unlikely because this child&#39;s language is age appropriate.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Two-year-old children with appropriate language development should combine words into 2-word phrases.&nbsp; In addition, a stranger should be able to understand at least half of a child&#39;s speech at age 2.</p>",
