Task complexity is increased because different anticoagulants may require different weight-based dose calculations (eg, mg/kg, mcg/kg/min, mg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>) and often rely heavily on <strong>accurate</strong> measurement and recording of <strong>patient weight</strong>.</p><p>Medication administration safety can be improved through system-based strategies that <strong>reduce human effort</strong> needed for correct action, such as <strong>standardization and simplification.</strong>&nbsp; For example, standardizing equipment to display <strong>only</strong> metric units (kilograms) eliminates the effort needed to manually record the correct units of weight (eg, also representing simplification of a process) and has the greatest potential to prevent the dosing error in this patient.</p><p>Other interventions, such as modified workflow policies (eg, requiring pharmacists to review medication dose calculations) and visual cues (eg, using prominent computer fonts that draw attention to high-risk data in patient charts), also can enhance safety.&nbsp; However, compared to standardization, these methods require more human effort and are vulnerable to operator error (eg, distractions, worker fatigue).&nbsp; System standardization is more effective in prevention because it completely eliminates the error-prone action (eg, differentiating between pounds and kilograms, manually entering units) <strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although having 2 individuals verify recorded weights may identify some errors, this method is less reliable compared to standardization because it requires human effort and is vulnerable to cognitive biases (eg, confirmation bias).&nbsp; In contrast, standardizing displays such that weight is always displayed in kilograms is more effective because it eliminates the need to double-check units of weight.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Use of incorrect units (eg, pounds instead of kilograms) in calculating weight-based medication doses (eg, heparin, tissue plasminogen activator) can result in fatal errors.&nbsp; System standardization (eg, using scales that display weight only in kilograms) is a highly effective strategy to prevent errors because it simplifies task complexity and reduces human effort needed for correct dosing.</p>",

Long-acting opioid agonists (eg, <strong>buprenorphine</strong>, methadone) provide steady activation of opioid receptors (physiologic dependence); therefore, replacement of illicit opioids with these agents prevents withdrawal, diminishes cravings, and reduces the euphoric effects of opioid misuse.&nbsp; This is associated with <strong>decreased</strong> incidence of relapse, <strong>drug overdose</strong>, and <strong>death</strong>.</p><p>Patients with OUD should be <strong>educated</strong> about this <strong>therapeutic rationale</strong> and these proven benefits to address the <strong>common misconception</strong> about &#x22;just trading one drug for another&#x22;; clear education regarding the risks (eg, misuse, overdose) associated with MAT should also be provided; shared decision-making improves the outcome of MAT.&nbsp; For patients who wish to avoid opioid agonists, have mild OUD, and are motivated, treatment with a pure opioid antagonist (ie, naltrexone) can be effective.</p><p>Adjunctive psychosocial support should also be provided for all patients who choose MAT.&nbsp; If a patient still prefers nonmedication treatment after education about the increased effectiveness of MAT, the decision should be supported, and multimodal psychosocial interventions (eg, addiction counseling, support groups) can be offered with the understanding that it is less likely to be effective <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; The mechanism of action of buprenorphine relies on activating opioid receptors and maintaining physical (physiologic) dependence to prevent withdrawal;&nbsp;however, abrupt discontinuation can still cause withdrawal.&nbsp; In addition, patient/family education, especially in the setting of a new diagnosis, should ideally be provided in plain, easy-to-understand language (eg, avoiding medical jargon such as &#x22;partial activation of receptors&#x22;).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Although the optimal duration of MAT with opioid agonists is not known, most patients with OUD require long-term therapy and many require lifelong treatment to prevent relapse.&nbsp; In rare cases, a slow taper of buprenorphine or methadone can be attempted if a patient has demonstrated stability (eg, no opioid misuse, productive lifestyle) and is highly motivated, but this usually requires months to years instead of days.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Medication-assisted therapy (MAT) with an opioid agonist (eg, buprenorphine, methadone) is first-line therapy for most patients with opioid use disorder.&nbsp; MAT decreases the risk of relapse, drug overdose, and death.&nbsp; Patients should be educated about the potential risks and benefits of MAT before deciding on treatment, and shared decision-making is necessary.</p>",
