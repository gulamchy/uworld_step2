BPD is diagnosed when a premature neonate continues to require <strong>supplemental oxygen </strong>at age <strong>&#8805;28 days</strong>.&nbsp; Signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions) are often present.</p><p>Previously (ie, before widespread use of antenatal steroids and neonatal surfactant), BPD was typically due to chronic ventilatory injury and oxygen toxicity&nbsp;and was&nbsp;characterized by fibrotic, scarred, and hyperinflated lungs.&nbsp; With regular use of noninvasive ventilation, BPD has evolved: &nbsp;Disease manifestations now primarily reflect&nbsp;<strong>arrest of pulmonary development</strong>.&nbsp; Impaired alveolarization results in a <strong>reduced number and septation of alveoli</strong>, and disrupted vasculogenesis causes dysmorphic and abnormally placed alveolar capillaries.</p><p>Management of BPD includes nutritional support, fluid restriction, and avoidance of mechanical lung damage.&nbsp; Over months, new alveoli develop, and pulmonary function can normalize.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Air dissecting from the alveoli into the interstitial space describes pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), which also&nbsp;typically affects premature infants who require mechanical ventilation and leads to progressive hypoxemia.&nbsp; Like other air leak syndromes (eg, pneumothorax), the greatest risk for PIE is within days of birth, when lung compliance is decreased and high airway pressures are needed to support breathing.&nbsp; This neonate has been on nasal cannula for weeks, making PIE unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cystic dilation of the bronchial wall with mucus plugging describes bronchiectasis, which can result from chronic inflammation, as in cystic fibrosis (CF).&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s stable oxygen requirement and lack of temperature instability make recurrent infection/inflammation unlikely, and most neonates with CF have delayed meconium passage and failure to thrive.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Protein loss due to immune-mediated gastrointestinal inflammation (eg, Crohn disease) typically causes diarrhea and failure to thrive, findings not seen in this patient.&nbsp; Moreover, this condition would be exceedingly unlikely in a neonate and is not associated with chronic oxygen therapy.&nbsp; Premature infants are at risk for protein loss with necrotizing enterocolitis, but this condition is infectious (invasion of gas-producing bacteria), not autoimmune.&nbsp; In addition, a mildly protuberant but soft abdomen is a normal finding in a neonate.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Refeeding syndrome (eg, hypophosphatemia, congestive heart failure) can occur when nutrition is reintroduced following prolonged malnutrition.&nbsp; Although this neonate recently started enteral feeds, he has been receiving intravenous nutrition with appropriate weight gain, eliminating the risk for this condition.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic complication of prematurity caused by the arrest of pulmonary development and characterized by a prolonged oxygen requirement.&nbsp;

Given his preterm status, cyanosis, x-ray findings, and responsiveness to oxygen supplementation, his presentation is most consistent with <strong>respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (RDS).&nbsp; RDS is due to <strong>surfactant deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Immature alveoli are unable to produce sufficient surfactant to reduce alveolar surface tension, leading to diffuse alveolar collapse.&nbsp; This explains why the incidence of RDS is inversely related to gestational age; <strong>preterm</strong> neonates (particularly if born &#8804;28 weeks gestation) are at highest risk.</p><p><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong> begin within <strong>minutes to hours after birth</strong> and include the following:</p><ul><li>Tachypnea</li><li>Grunting (to increase end-expiratory pressure and maintain alveolar volume)</li><li>Nasal flaring (to decrease airway resistance)</li><li>Retractions (due to high intrathoracic pressure)</li><li>Hypoxia and cyanosis (due to atelectasis and ventilation/perfusion mismatch)</li></ul><p>Hypoxia also leads to vasoconstriction of pulmonary vasculature, causing increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus [DA] or foramen ovale, further worsening cyanosis.&nbsp; <a href=\"38748\">X-ray findings of RDS</a> include diffuse, reticular, <strong>ground-glass opacities</strong> and <strong>air bronchograms</strong> (air-filled bronchi surrounded by atelectasis).</p><p>Administration of maternal antenatal glucocorticoids, which stimulate fetal surfactant synthesis, reduces but may not eliminate the risk for RDS.&nbsp; Neonatal treatment includes continuous positive airway pressure ventilation; mechanical ventilation and exogenous surfactant therapy are reserved for severe cases.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Severe aortic coarctation can present with shock due to poor distal perfusion on <a href=\"209\">closure of the DA</a>.&nbsp; However, the DA begins to constrict as early as 12 hours (not immediately) after birth.&nbsp; Moreover, a lower postductal (eg, left lower extremity) than preductal (eg, right upper extremity) oxygen saturation would be expected.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s soft murmur likely represents a physiologically open DA.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1759\">D-transposition of the great arteries</a> causes systemic circulation of deoxygenated blood, resulting in tachypnea and cyanosis without retractions or grunting.&nbsp; Because most of the systemic blood flow bypasses the pulmonary vasculature, supplemental oxygen does not significantly improve oxygenation.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn is characterized by high pulmonary vascular resistance, causing right-to-left shunting across the DA.&nbsp; Cyanosis and respiratory distress occur, but chest x-ray is often normal, and preductal oxygen saturation is typically higher than postductal saturation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Transient tachypnea of the newborn causes respiratory distress in the first few hours of life due to delayed resorption of alveolar fluid.&nbsp; Respiratory symptoms and cyanosis are typically mild, unlike in this patient, and <a href=\"36157\">chest x-ray</a> reveals perihilar streaking and fluid in the interlobar fissures.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Respiratory distress syndrome classically presents in preterm infants with grunting, flaring, retractions, and cyanosis immediately after birth.&nbsp; Chest x-ray shows diffuse, ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms.</p>",

Physical examination findings can be helpful in differentiating lung pathology, especially consolidation and pleural effusion.</p><p>Breath sounds represent air movement within the lung and tactile fremitus is caused by tissue vibration that occurs during air movement.&nbsp; In general, sound and vibration travel faster and more efficiently in solids or liquids than in air, which results in increased intensity of breath sounds and increased tactile fremitus in patients with a consolidative process <strong>inside</strong> the lung (eg, bacterial pneumonia).&nbsp; However, if <strong>fluid</strong> (pleural effusion) or air (pneumothorax) are present just <strong>outside</strong> the lung in the thoracic cavity, they can act to <strong>insulate</strong> sound and vibration originating from the lung, which leads to <strong>decreased breath sounds</strong> and <strong>decreased tactile fremitus</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dullness to percussion</strong> occurs in both pleural effusion and lung consolidation due to an increase in tissue/fluid density compared to normal air-filled lung tissue.&nbsp;

Increased breath sounds, increased tactile fremitus, and dullness to percussion are characteristic of a consolidative lung process such as lobar pneumonia.&nbsp; The blunting of the right costophrenic angle on this patient&#39;s chest x-ray is consistent with pleural effusion rather than isolated <a href=\"45601\">consolidation</a>.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;
