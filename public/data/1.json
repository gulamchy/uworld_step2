This patient has multiple fall <strong>risk factors</strong>, including <strong>prior history of a fall</strong>, decreased muscle strength, and history of a chronic condition (eg, hypertension, osteoarthritis).</p><p>All patients who have fallen should undergo a <strong>multifactorial risk assessment</strong> that includes screening for <strong>sensory disturbances</strong>, a major underlying contributor to fall risk in the elderly population.&nbsp; For example, age-related declines in <strong>proprioception</strong> affect <strong>balance</strong>, leaving patients with increased reliance on visual input.&nbsp; As a result, diminished <strong>visual acuity</strong> can substantially elevate overall fall risk.&nbsp; In addition, age-related eye conditions (eg, macular degeneration, cataracts) can reduce dark adaptation, increasing risk for falls in low-light conditions.&nbsp; Therefore, all patients who sustain a fall should have visual acuity screening with a dilated eye examination and receive appropriate corrective eyewear or prevention interventions (eg, surgical treatment of cataracts, nutritional supplementation for macular degeneration).</p><p>In patients who have sustained previous falls, supervised balance and strength training and a home safety assessment (typically performed by an occupational therapist) are also recommended to further reduce risk for subsequent falls.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Holter monitoring is rarely indicated in average-risk elderly patients who sustain falls in the absence of concerning symptoms (eg, history of palpitations, frequent syncope).&nbsp; Carotid artery stenosis is also not a typical cause of falls.&nbsp; Sensory function (eg, balance, vision) should be tested first.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although vasodilators (eg, calcium channel blockers) may increase fall risk in some patients, discontinuation of this patient&#39;s ACE inhibitor is not recommended given her hypertension and lack of orthostasis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Assistive devices (eg, canes, scooters, walkers) may be needed in select cases.&nbsp; However, the specific type of device should be identified only after multifactorial assessment (eg, physical therapy evaluation, home safety assessment) is completed.&nbsp; Use of assistive devices without adequate training or assessment has been linked to increased risks (eg, tripping over the device, muscle atrophy from disuse).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; This patient may eventually require increased assistance if she experiences further functional declines or falls.&nbsp; However, preservation of independence is often highly desired by patients, and attempts should first be made to screen for correctable contributors to fall risk.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Age-related declines in proprioception lead to increased reliance on visual input, and diminished visual acuity can substantially elevate fall risk in dark settings.&nbsp;
