Proximal arm weakness usually follows, leading to difficulty working with the arms overhead.&nbsp; Patients may develop dysphagia due to involvement of the striated muscles of the upper pharynx.&nbsp; Mild pain or tenderness can develop due to inflammation; however, significant pain or a lack of weakness should prompt consideration of <a href=\"2299\">other diagnoses</a>.&nbsp; Polymyositis is similar to dermatomyositis but without skin findings.</p><p><strong>Muscle enzymes</strong> (eg, creatine kinase) are invariably elevated, and <strong>autoantibodies</strong> (eg, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Jo-1 antibodies) are present in most cases.&nbsp; A <strong>muscle biopsy</strong> is the most definitive diagnostic test and shows a mononuclear infiltrate surrounding necrotic and regenerating muscle fibers.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are present in myasthenia gravis, which is characterized by muscle fatigability (weakness increases with repeated activity) and involves oculobulbar muscles in addition to proximal limb muscles.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and G)</strong>&nbsp; ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) can cause hyperkalemia, leading to flaccid paralysis.&nbsp; However, this is unlikely to evolve over months and is uncommon in patients without underlying renal insufficiency or additional medications that cause hyperkalemia.&nbsp; Hypercalcemia can also cause weakness, but significant hypercalcemia would likely be associated with additional symptoms (eg, nausea, constipation, polydipsia).</p><p><strong>(Choices C and D)</strong>&nbsp; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are inflammatory markers often used in the assessment of polymyalgia rheumatica, a syndrome characterized by proximal muscle pain and stiffness out of proportion to weakness.&nbsp; It most often affects the shoulders.&nbsp; In polymyositis, weakness is typically more prominent than pain.&nbsp; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be elevated but are nonspecific.&nbsp; Electromyography is useful for differentiating polymyositis from other causes of weakness (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) but is also nonspecific.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; This patient has no findings to warrant an MRI, such as back/radicular pain (herniated disk), bowel/bladder dysfunction (cauda equina syndrome), abnormal sensory examination (cord compression), or fever or intravenous drug use (epidural abscess).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Polymyositis is characterized by chronic proximal weakness.&nbsp;
