Many also start to cut with scissors and draw a square.&nbsp; Typical language skills include speaking in <strong>simple sentences</strong> that contain &#8805;<strong>4 words</strong> and can be <strong>understood by a stranger</strong>.&nbsp; Four-year-olds should also be able to <strong>name colors</strong>, answer straightforward questions, and talk about something that happened in their day.</p><p>This patient&#39;s presentation is concerning for a <strong>language disorder</strong>, including his difficulty making himself understood in multiple settings (eg, home, school), use of only 2- or 3-word phrases, and inability to name colors <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.&nbsp; Language disorders are characterized by a <strong>deficit</strong> in <strong>understanding</strong> and/or <strong>producing language</strong> and can present with a limited vocabulary, inaccurate sentence structure, or difficulty using language to explain concepts or create a story.&nbsp; Children who have difficulty verbalizing their needs or being understood often express frustration in other ways (eg, temper tantrums) or attempt to have their needs met through physical aggression (eg, hitting, grabbing).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Language difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder may include rote repetition of words as well as difficulty maintaining conversation due to either a preoccupation with specific interests or a lack of understanding social cues.&nbsp; In contrast, this child is repeatedly attempting to communicate with others and wants to be understood.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by an irritable or angry mood with repeated temper tantrums that are out of proportion to the stimulus and inappropriate for developmental level.&nbsp; Because temper tantrums are common in young children, the diagnosis is not made in children until age &#8805;6.&nbsp; This child&#39;s tantrums are likely the result of being misunderstood rather than generalized irritability or anger.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Global developmental delay is characterized by deficits in multiple areas.&nbsp; Apart from a language delay, this child&#39;s developmental milestones are on target.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)&nbsp; </strong>Language disorder in a preschooler may be the precursor of a specific learning disorder, but diagnosis of this condition requires standardized testing in a school-age child to identify a particular deficit in reading, written expression, or mathematics.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Language disorder is characterized by difficulty understanding and/or producing language.&nbsp; It can result in behavioral difficulties (eg, temper tantrums, physical aggression) due to frustration over the inability to express thoughts and feelings.</p>",
