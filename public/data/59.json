Patients can have a <strong>brief hyperthyroid phase</strong> due to release of preformed thyroid hormone but frequently have only mild, nonspecific symptoms (eg, anxiety [as seen in this patient], palpitations).&nbsp; The subsequent <strong>hypothyroid phase</strong> (eg, fatigue, weight gain despite normal appetite, constipation) often brings patients to medical attention.&nbsp; Examination typically shows a nontender goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, lower extremity edema, and other findings (eg, coarse facies, delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation).&nbsp; In the hypothyroid phase, <strong>TSH</strong> will be elevated and <strong>free T4</strong> levels will be low.&nbsp; Other laboratory findings associated with hypothyroidism include hypercholesterolemia (due to thyroid effects on lipid metabolism) and hyponatremia.</p><p>Postpartum thyroiditis is similar to painless (silent) thyroiditis, but by convention the latter is not diagnosed within a year of childbirth.&nbsp; Both may be considered variants of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis and are associated with elevated titers of <strong>anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies</strong>.&nbsp; However, whereas Hashimoto thyroiditis frequently leads to permanent hypothyroidism, postpartum and painless thyroiditis are usually self-limited, and patients return to a euthyroid state over several months.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression cause overlapping symptoms.&nbsp; Hypothyroidism should be excluded first as it is a reversible cause of depression.&nbsp; In general, postpartum depression is more often associated with weight loss and additional depressive symptoms (eg, anhedonia, feelings of inappropriate guilt).&nbsp; If thyroid function is normal, depression would be more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Peripartum cardiomyopathy is characterized by systolic heart failure and occurs in the last month of pregnancy or up to 5 months after delivery.&nbsp; It can lead to edema and hyponatremia but would not occur 6 months after pregnancy and would present with respiratory features (eg, dyspnea, orthopnea, lung crackles) and tachycardia (rather than borderline bradycardia).&nbsp; Hypothyroidism can cause lower extremity edema.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Weight gain and hypercholesterolemia in postpartum hypothyroidism usually resolve with restoration of the euthyroid state.&nbsp; Directed lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions are not usually needed.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency can both cause hyponatremia.&nbsp; However, adrenal insufficiency is unlikely in this patient in light of the associated edema, weight gain, and normal blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Postpartum thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a possible brief hyperthyroid phase, a self-limited hypothyroid phase, and an ultimate return to a euthyroid state.&nbsp; It is associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies.&nbsp; Painless (silent) thyroiditis is a similar disorder, but by convention is not diagnosed within a year of childbirth.</p>",

Given her <strong>CNS symptoms</strong> (ie, headache, visual disturbances), <strong>TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma</strong> is the most likely cause.&nbsp; Thyrotroph adenomas are most commonly macroadenomas and can generate symptoms related to mass effects (eg, optic chiasm or pituitary stalk compression); they may also cosecrete other pituitary hormones (eg, growth hormone, prolactin).</p><p>The following additional findings are often seen in thyrotroph adenomas:</p><ul><li><p>Diffuse, nontender goiter (due to stimulation of thyroid follicles by TSH)</p></li><li><p>Menstrual symptoms (eg, due to ovulatory dysfunction from excess thyroid hormone)</p></li><li><p>Galactorrhea (eg, prolactin cosecretion or disrupted <a href=\"3419\">prolactin regulation</a> due to pituitary stalk compression)</p></li></ul><p>Additional laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis include an elevated serum alpha subunit (found in glycoprotein hormones such as TSH); levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and prolactin should also be assessed.&nbsp; <strong>Radioiodine uptake</strong> is <strong>diffusely increased</strong> due to increased thyroid hormone synthesis; <strong>MRI of the pituitary</strong> confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Management includes beta blockers (eg, propranolol) for symptom control, somatostatin analogues (eg, octreotide) to reduce TSH secretion, and transsphenoidal resection of the tumor.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone is an uncommon autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor.&nbsp; Patients have elevated T3 and T4 and normal to elevated TSH levels, often with an associated goiter.&nbsp; However, most patients are clinically hypothyroid, not hyperthyroid.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Graves disease typically presents with hyperthyroidism and diffuse goiter.&nbsp; However, TSH is suppressed, and patients often have infiltrative ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis occasionally presents with a transient hyperthyroid phase due to inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles and release of thyroid hormone.&nbsp; However, TSH is suppressed.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Normal pregnancy is associated with the upregulation of thyroid hormone production due to increased thyroid-binding globulin and stimulation of TSH receptors by hCG; TSH levels typically decrease due to feedback inhibition of TSH secretion.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Surreptitious intake of thyroid hormone is occasionally seen in patients attempting to lose weight.&nbsp; In such cases, TSH is suppressed and the thyroid would not be enlarged.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas cause hyperthyroidism with elevated thyroid hormone and TSH levels.&nbsp; Most TSH-secreting tumors are macroadenomas and can be associated with mass effect symptoms, including headache, visual field defects, and impaired function of surrounding pituitary tissue.</p>",

Proposed mechanisms include a rapid increase in serum thyroid hormone levels or increased sensitivity to thyroid hormone.&nbsp; Characteristic features include tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), and fever up to 40-41 C (104-106 F).&nbsp; Other findings include anxiety, altered mentation, seizure, severe nausea, vomiting, hepatic dysfunction, tremor, lid lag, and goiter.</p><p>Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by thyroid function studies documenting hyperthyroidism.&nbsp; Treatment includes beta blockers (eg, propranolol) for symptom control, thionamides (eg, propylthiouracil) to block new hormone synthesis, iodine solution to block thyroid hormone release (given at least an hour after propylthiouracil to prevent excess iodine incorporation into thyroid hormone), and glucocorticoids to decrease peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (and treat a potential relative adrenal insufficiency).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Echocardiography can identify causes of congestive heart failure or arrhythmias (eg, abnormal valves, ventricular dysfunction).&nbsp; However, this patient has no features of heart failure, and echocardiography is not needed.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Fluid resuscitation and intravenous dexamethasone should be given to patients with suspected <a href=\"2366\">acute adrenal insufficiency</a>.&nbsp; These patients will have hypotension often associated with tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and weakness.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous dantrolene can treat malignant hyperthermia (MH), a hypermetabolic syndrome due to volatile anesthetics leading to sustained muscle contraction and breakdown.&nbsp; MH typically presents with hypercarbia, sinus tachycardia, muscle rigidity, significantly elevated creatine kinase (can reach &gt;10,000-20,000 U/L), hyperkalemia (due to muscle breakdown), and hyperthermia.&nbsp; In this patient, the presence of lid lag, the absence of muscle rigidity, and the normokalemia are more consistent with thyroid storm than MH.&nbsp; Her moderate creatine kinase elevation likely reflects muscle injury related to trauma or surgery.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Intravenous lorazepam can treat alcohol withdrawal, which usually presents with tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status.&nbsp; Fever is atypical with early withdrawal but can occur with delirium tremens, which develops 72-96 hours after the last drink.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s history of moderate alcohol use makes withdrawal less likely, and alcohol withdrawal would not explain her lid lag.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Free plasma metanephrines are elevated in pheochromocytoma, which usually presents with episodic hypertension and the classic triad (episodic headache, diaphoresis, and tachycardia).&nbsp; Pheochromocytoma is usually not associated with high fever.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Thyroid storm is a life-threatening thyrotoxicosis often triggered by thyroid or non-thyroid surgery, trauma, infection, iodine contrast, or childbirth.&nbsp; It is characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, high fever, tremor, altered mentation, and lid lag.</p>",
