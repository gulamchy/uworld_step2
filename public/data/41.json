The goal is to maintain PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> at 60-90 mm Hg, corresponding to an oxygen saturation of <a href=\"43737\">92%-96%</a>.&nbsp; Immediately following intubation, a high FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (eg, &#8805;60%, or 0.6) is usually provided and can subsequently be adjusted based on the results of the first arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.</p><p>PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is influenced mainly by FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> and PEEP.&nbsp;

ARDS presents clinically as dyspnea, tachypnea, significant hypoxemia, and bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray, all developing within a week of a clinical insult (eg, pancreatitis).&nbsp; <strong>Mechanical ventilation</strong> is often required to support patients&#39; lungs.</p><p>The goal of mechanical ventilation in ARDS is to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation <strong>without causing further injury</strong> to the lungs.&nbsp; This is accomplished by using lung-protective strategies such as <strong>low-tidal-volume ventilation</strong> (LTVV) (ideal tidal volume = 4-6 mL/kg of ideal body weight).</p><p>In ARDS, a significant number of the alveoli remain collapsed despite positive airway pressure, and any tidal volume delivered by the ventilator is distributed to those remaining open (functional &#x22;baby lung&#x22;).&nbsp; LTVV <strong>prevents overdistension of these alveoli</strong>.&nbsp; Compared to use of higher tidal volumes (&#8805;8 mL/kg), LTVV <strong>improves mortality</strong> in patients with ARDS (number needed to treat = 11).&nbsp; Higher tidal volumes cause excessive stretching of damaged and delicate alveoli to further compound the lung injury.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Low tidal volumes induce hypoventilation; therefore, LTVV commonly causes mild hypercapnic respiratory acidosis.&nbsp; This permissive hypercapnia is well tolerated and is correlated with improved survival, likely because it reflects adherence to LTVV, protecting the lungs from further trauma.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, cisatracurium) are useful in promoting patient-ventilator synchrony to improve gas exchange and reduce barotrauma, as well as in minimizing oxygen consumption by skeletal muscle.&nbsp; Neither an adverse effect nor a benefit of these agents has been established regarding patient mortality.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; In ARDS, positive end-expiratory pressure is needed to recruit and aerate collapsed alveoli.&nbsp; Decreasing alveolar recruitment is associated with higher lung stiffness, poor oxygenation, and likely poorer outcomes.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; In the normal supine position, ventilation is already high in the ventral lung regions, and a further increase causes alveolar overdistension.&nbsp; <a href=\"41334\">Prone positioning</a> distributes the ventilation from the ventral to the dorsal (dependent) lung regions, where the majority of alveoli are located.&nbsp; This improves the homogeneity of ventilation throughout the lungs and decreases mortality in patients with ARDS (number needed to treat = 6).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation without causing further injury to the lungs.&nbsp; Low-tidal-volume ventilation is a lung-protective strategy that reduces alveolar overdistension to decrease mortality in patients with ARDS.&nbsp; Prone positioning also decreases mortality, likely by homogenizing ventilation throughout the lungs.</p>",
