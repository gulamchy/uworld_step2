The acute management of NSTEMI involves medical management usually followed by prompt (but nonemergency) coronary angiography (often within 24 hr) to evaluate the atherosclerotic coronary anatomy and determine the need for stent placement or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).&nbsp; This patient opted for medical management only.</p><p>Initial medical management should include a beta blocker (eg, metoprolol) to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, anticoagulation to reduce thrombus formation, and a high-intensity statin (eg, atorvastatin) to stabilize atherosclerotic plaque.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)</strong> with <strong>aspirin</strong> and a <strong>P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> receptor blocker</strong> (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) should be given to <strong>reduce platelet activity</strong>.&nbsp; In patients planning to undergo coronary angiography within 24 hours, withholding the initiation of P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> inhibitor therapy until after the procedure is often reasonable because patients in whom <a href=\"58523\">CABG is indicated</a> must delay surgery for at least 5 days if they have already received a P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> inhibitor.&nbsp; In this patient who has declined percutaneous coronary intervention, a P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> inhibitor should be given without delay.</p><p>DAPT should be continued (eg, for ~1 year) following MI, regardless of whether a stent is placed, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent MI and cardiovascular death.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Apixaban is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant indicated for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolic disease.&nbsp; However, in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), it has been associated with increased bleeding without a significant decrease in recurrent ischemic events.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Ibuprofen and colchicine are used to treat acute pericarditis, which can develop after MI.&nbsp; These drugs are not used in the early management of NSTEMI or other ACS.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Supplemental oxygen is recommended in patients with oxygen saturation levels &lt;90%.&nbsp; In normoxic patients, oxygen supplementation has no added benefit, and hyperoxia may be associated with harm due to vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Nitroglycerin is used to treat active ischemic chest pain in patients with ACS but has no added mortality benefit.&nbsp; Other indications for nitrates in ACS include hypertension and pulmonary edema.&nbsp; Because this patient arrived in the emergency department pain free, the use of nitrates is not indicated.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> inhibitor is an important part of the acute medical management of acute coronary syndrome.</p>",

The right ventricle is involved in up to half of inferior wall MIs, which are recognized by ischemic changes in ECG leads II, III, and aVF and commonly present with atypical <strong>epigastric pain</strong> rather than classic substernal chest pain.&nbsp; <strong>Nausea</strong> is also common, but when MI primarily affects the right ventricle, shortness of breath is rarely present (due to absence of pulmonary edema).&nbsp; Because inferior wall MI usually results from obstruction of the right coronary artery, which usually supplies blood to the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, <strong>bradyarrhythmias</strong> (eg, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block) are frequently present.</p><p>Marked <strong>hypotension</strong> is a characteristic feature of RVMI.&nbsp; The infarcted right ventricle experiences acute <a href=\"21883\">contractile dysfunction</a> and is often unable to pump adequate blood through the pulmonary circulation, resulting in decreased left ventricular preload, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension.&nbsp; Management of RVMI differs from left ventricular MI in that the failing right ventricle is highly sensitive to inadequate preload.&nbsp; Nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin) should be avoided because they reduce RV preload and can profoundly worsen hypotension <strong>(Choice D)</strong>.&nbsp; Intravenous normal saline is often needed to further increase RV preload and assist blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to improve hypotension.</p><p>Whenever inferior wall MI is suspected based on ischemic changes in the inferior ECG leads, RV involvement should be evaluated using a <strong>right-sided precordial ECG</strong>, which is obtained via precordial lead placement in a <a href=\"2583\">mirror image</a> on the right side of the chest.&nbsp; ST-segment elevation in lead V4R is highly accurate in confirming RVMI.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; CT pulmonary angiography is indicated to evaluate for acute pulmonary embolism (PE), which can present with hypotension and ischemic changes in the inferior ECG leads.&nbsp; However, epigastric pain location is not typical for PE, and this patient&#39;s absence of shortness of breath and tachycardia make PE less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Diuretics (eg, furosemide) reduce RV preload and should be avoided with suspected RVMI.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Upright abdominal x-ray can recognize air under the diaphragm and is indicated to evaluate for a ruptured peptic ulcer.&nbsp; Although epigastric pain is common, abdominal tenderness and tachycardia are also expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Right ventricular myocardial infarction commonly presents with epigastric pain and nausea and is commonly associated with hypotension and bradycardia.&nbsp; A right-sided precordial ECG should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

Inferior wall MI classically presents with <strong>chest or epigastric pain</strong> and commonly involves <strong>vagal symptoms</strong> (eg, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting).&nbsp; Because the inferior wall is usually supplied by the right coronary artery, which also usually supplies the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, <strong>bradyarrhythmias</strong> (eg, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block) are common.&nbsp; Inferior wall MI can affect the inferior and posterior portions of the left ventricle, but it often primarily affects the right ventricle.</p><p><strong>Right ventricular MI</strong> (RVMI) involves characteristic features that differ from left ventricular MI.&nbsp; There is abruptly <strong>decreased RV contractility</strong> with increased RV preload that causes <strong>jugular venous distension</strong> (JVD) and sometimes a murmur of secondary tricuspid regurgitation (resulting from RV dilation).&nbsp; The failing RV is unable to pump adequate blood through the pulmonary circulation to the left atrium, resulting in decreased left ventricular preload (with <strong>clear lungs</strong>), reduced cardiac output, and often profound <strong>hypotension</strong>.&nbsp; Unlike left ventricular MI, which benefits from a reduction in RV preload (eg, with nitroglycerin), a reduction in RV preload can significantly worsen hypotension with RVMI.&nbsp; Intravenous normal saline to further increase RV preload is often needed to aid left ventricular filling and improve hypotension.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; The reduced cardiac output and hypotension with RVMI (eg, <a href=\"21883\">right-sided heart failure</a>) causes a reflexive increase in systemic vascular resistance.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Increased intrapericardial pressure occurs in cardiac tamponade, which involves impaired RV filling and can present similarly to RVMI with hypotension, JVD, and clear lungs.&nbsp; However, distant heart sounds and tachycardia are expected, and tamponade does not explain a tricuspid regurgitation murmur.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Interventricular septum rupture is a mechanical complication of MI that causes left-to-right interventricular shunting.&nbsp; Patients typically develop biventricular failure with pulmonary edema.&nbsp; The associated systolic murmur is expected to decrease with inspiration (due to increased right-sided pressure and reduced shunting through the septal defect).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause obstruction of RV outflow and can present similarly to RVMI with hypotension, JVD, and clear lungs.&nbsp; However, tachycardia is expected.&nbsp; Nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes are common with PE, but ST-segment elevation is highly unusual.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Inferior wall myocardial infarction commonly involves vagal symptoms (eg, nausea) and bradyarrhythmias and often primarily affects the right ventricle.&nbsp; Right ventricular myocardial infarction presents with jugular venous distension, clear lungs, and often profound hypotension caused by impaired delivery of blood to the left ventricle.</p>",

LV free wall rupture is a <strong>mechanical complication</strong> of myocardial infarction (MI) that can occur up to 2 weeks following transmural MI, with ~50% of cases occurring within 5 days of the MI.&nbsp; It most commonly complicates MI affecting the left anterior descending artery (as in this case), because the anterior LV wall must withstand high LV pressures and is prone to high shear stress.&nbsp; <strong>Delayed reperfusion</strong> (or no reperfusion) increases the risk due to more extensive myocardial necrosis.</p><p>LV free wall rupture typically presents with sudden-onset <strong>chest pain</strong>.&nbsp; As blood fills the pericardial space, <strong>cardiac tamponade</strong> rapidly develops and leads to <strong>obstructive shock</strong> with hypotension and tachycardia.&nbsp; Within minutes or less, cardiac output markedly drops and <strong>pulseless electrical activity</strong> (PEA) ensues; PEA refers to cardiac arrest occurring with a potentially perfusing rhythm (eg, junctional) but no palpable pulse.&nbsp; It often has a potentially <a href=\"6091\">reversible cause</a>.</p><p>LV free wall rupture has a high mortality rate; however, rapid recognition with echocardiography and pericardiocentesis and treatment with emergency surgical repair can be lifesaving.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; Interventricular septum rupture may occur acutely or within 5 days of an MI, and commonly leads to biventricular failure and cardiogenic shock<strong>. </strong> Papillary muscle rupture of the mitral valve typically occurs acutely or within 5 days of an MI (usually affecting the posteromedial papillary muscle supplied by the right coronary artery), and patients quickly develop severe left-sided heart failure and cardiogenic shock.&nbsp; These mechanical complications are expected to cause pulmonary edema and are much less likely than free wall rupture to cause rapid PEA arrest.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Recurrent ischemia may occur from repeat MI, but cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia usually involves ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation rather than PEA.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Right ventricular MI can cause acute-onset hypotension that may progress to shock, but it is commonly accompanied by sinus bradycardia and is not expected to cause PEA as rapidly as LV free wall rupture.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Ventricular aneurysm may develop weeks to several months following an MI affecting the left anterior descending artery and usually presents gradually with decompensated heart failure or angina.</p><p><strong>Educational objective</strong>:<br>Left ventricular free wall rupture can occur within 5 days or up to 2 weeks following transmural myocardial infarction.&nbsp; Affected patients have sudden-onset chest pain and rapid development of cardiac tamponade that quickly leads to obstructive shock and pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest.</p>",

It most commonly complicates <a href=\"4119\">anterolateral MI</a> affecting the perfusion field of the left anterior descending artery.</p><p>ST-segment elevation on ECG usually normalizes within a few weeks of MI.&nbsp; LV aneurysm presents with <a href=\"4973\">ECG findings</a> of <strong>persistent ST-segment elevation</strong> and <strong>deep Q waves in the same leads</strong>.&nbsp; Large LV aneurysm can lead to progressive LV enlargement, causing heart failure, refractory angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and mitral annular dilation with secondary mitral regurgitation (explaining this patient&#39;s murmur).&nbsp; A mural thrombus can also develop within the aneurysm, creating risk of systemic arterial embolization (eg, stroke).&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed by <strong>echocardiography</strong> showing a thinned, dyskinetic LV wall in the area of the prior MI.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pericarditis, which can present in the first several days after MI, can cause diffuse ST-segment elevation.&nbsp; Postcardiac injury syndrome (Dressler syndrome), an immune-mediated pericarditis, can occur weeks to months after MI.&nbsp; This patient does not have features of pericarditis (eg, pleuritic chest pain, fever, pericardial friction rub) or an associated pericardial effusion.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Papillary muscle rupture, a mechanical complication typically occurring acutely or within 3-5 days after MI, usually presents dramatically with acute, severe mitral regurgitation (eg, hypotension, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Recurrent ischemia is a consideration with ST-segment elevation, but is less likely as this patient has no chest pain and ECG tracings are unchanged since the MI.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Right ventricular infarction typically involves ischemic changes in the inferior ECG leads (II, III, and aVF).&nbsp; It causes acute right ventricular failure and usually presents with hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and clear lung fields.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; LV free wall rupture is a potential complication of transmural MI, usually occurring within 5 days (but can occur up to 2 weeks) following the event.&nbsp; Affected patients rapidly develop cardiac tamponade with abrupt-onset hypotension, shock, and often cardiac arrest.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Left ventricular (LV) aneurysm occurs as a late complication of transmural (ST-segment elevation) myocardial infarction.&nbsp; ECG typically reveals persistent ST-segment elevation along with deep Q waves.&nbsp; Progressive LV enlargement can cause heart failure, refractory angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and secondary mitral regurgitation, and patients can develop a mural thrombus with risk of systemic arterial embolization.</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p><strong>Nitrates</strong> are excellent antianginal drugs and are used frequently to relieve chest pain in patients with stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome.&nbsp; Nitrates are primarily <strong>vasodilators</strong> and dilate veins, arterioles, and coronary arteries by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells.&nbsp; Although nitrates act as venodilators and coronary vasodilators, their primary <strong>anti-ischemic effects</strong> are <strong>due to systemic vasodilation rather than coronary vasodilation</strong>.</p><p>Systemic venodilation <strong>lowers preload and left ventricular end-diastolic volume</strong> and reduces myocardial oxygen demand by <strong>reducing wall stress</strong>.&nbsp; Nitrates also cause arterial and arteriolar vasodilation, although to a lesser degree, and can decrease systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.&nbsp; The fall in systemic blood pressure reduces wall stress, which leads to further decrease in <strong>myocardial oxygen demand</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Nitrates do not have a direct effect on heart rate.&nbsp; However, a fall in blood pressure with nitrates can induce reflex tachycardia with an increase in myocardial oxygen demand and worsening angina.&nbsp; This can best be prevented by concomitant use of beta blockers.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Nitrates have no direct effect on cardiac chronotropy or inotropy (contractility) and left ventricular ejection fraction.&nbsp; They can indirectly cause reflex tachycardia in patients with a significant fall in blood pressure.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and F)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic venodilation caused by nitrates leads to a decrease, <strong>not</strong> an increase, in preload.&nbsp; Systemic arterial dilation also causes a decrease in afterload, which occurs to a much lesser degree than a decrease in preload.&nbsp; In contrast, an increase in preload and/or afterload will cause an increase in wall stress with increased myocardial oxygen demand and worsening angina.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Nitrates have no direct effect on left ventricular compliance.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>The primary anti-ischemic and antianginal effects of nitrates are due to systemic vasodilation rather than coronary vasodilation.&nbsp; Systemic venodilation lowers preload and left ventricular end-diastolic volume, reducing wall stress and myocardial oxygen demand.</p>",
