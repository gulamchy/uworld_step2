Further, this patient&#39;s likely medication history makes a medication-enhanced physiologic tremor more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hyperthyroidism can cause an enhanced physiologic tremor indistinguishable from this patients&#39; based on tremor characteristics.&nbsp; However, additional symptoms (eg, weight loss, heat intolerance) and findings of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperreflexia) are typically present.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; In contrast to this patient, patients with Parkinson disease classically have a resting tremor that improves with intentional movement.&nbsp; In addition, tremor is accompanied by rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Certain medications (eg, lithium) can enhance a physiologic tremor, which is typically a fine, symmetric action tremor of the hands that increases with sympathetic activity.</p>",

DLB is characterized by well-formed visual hallucinations (eg, detailed images of people/small animals) that occur&nbsp;early in the disease;&nbsp;similar hallucinations are sometimes seen with PD,&nbsp;but they are classically related to drug (eg, dopaminergic) therapy and occur later in the disease.&nbsp; However, <strong>minor</strong> hallucinations (uncommon in DLB) occur in approximately 40% of patients with <strong>untreated PD</strong> and can be a premotor symptom; in contrast to well-formed visual hallucinations, minor hallucinations are characterized as <strong>sensations of presence</strong> (ie, someone nearby) and/<strong>or passage</strong> (ie, someone passing through peripheral vision), as seen in this patient.</p></li><li><p>Other features:&nbsp; Findings more characteristic of PD include asymmetric parkinsonism, more <strong>gradual progression</strong>, earlier onset, and increased levodopa responsiveness (vs DLB).</p></li></ul><p>This patient does not have dementia (eg, normal cognitive assessment, intact activities of daily living such as driving and shopping) despite longstanding parkinsonism (eg, tremor starting years ago); he also has minor hallucinations of passage.&nbsp; These features make PD more likely than DLB <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can cause extrapyramidal signs (eg, bradykinesia, rigidity) and visual hallucinations.&nbsp; However, neuromotor manifestations typically include myoclonus, cerebellar signs (eg, ataxia), and/or upper motor neuron findings.&nbsp; Moreover, patients have rapidly progressive dementia with decline to death usually occurring within one year of disease onset.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although major depressive disorder with psychotic features frequently involves hallucinations, the psychotic symptoms typically have depressive themes (eg, guilt, worthlessness), unlike the passage/presence hallucinations seen with untreated PD.&nbsp; In addition, this patient has only one clear symptom of depression (low energy), and depression would not explain parkinsonism.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Normal pressure hydrocephalus is associated with urinary incontinence, gait disorder, and cognitive decline (&#x22;wet, wobbly, wacky&#x22;).&nbsp; Hallucinations and parkinsonism are not characteristic.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) both cause parkinsonism and dementia but can be distinguished by timing (PD: dementia &gt;1 year after parkinsonism; DLB: dementia prior to or &lt;1 year after parkinsonism).&nbsp; Well-formed hallucinations are more common in DLB (and can occur in PD patients receiving dopaminergic therapy), but minor hallucinations (presence/passage) can be seen even in untreated PD.</p>",
