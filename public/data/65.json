The synovial fluid analysis shows a mildly elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils.&nbsp; This is consistent with an inflammatory process, most likely a <strong>prosthetic joint infection</strong> (PJI).&nbsp; The leukocyte count in the synovial fluid in PJI is usually elevated to &gt;1000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font> but is often lower than in septic native joints (usually &gt;50,000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).</p><p>PJI can be acquired by <strong>perioperative contamination</strong> of the joint or by extension from an overlying wound infection:</p><ul><li>Infections due to <strong>virulent organisms</strong> (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) typically present within the <strong>first 3 months</strong> after surgery (early onset infection) with acute pain, fever, leukocytosis, and overt local signs of infection (eg, erythema, purulent drainage), not seen in this patient <strong>(Choices E and G)</strong>.</li><li>Infections due to less virulent organisms (eg, <strong>coagulase-negative staphylococci</strong>, <em>Propionibacterium</em> species), as in this patient, are likely to have a <strong>delayed onset</strong> (3-12 months) and present with chronic pain, implant loosening, gait impairment, or sinus tract formation.&nbsp;

In children, <strong>seizures</strong> in the setting of acute bacterial gastroenteritis should raise concern for <em><strong>Shigella</strong></em> infection.&nbsp; <em>Shigella sonnei</em> is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water and is sometimes implicated in outbreaks in community settings (eg, day care facilities) due to the low infectious dose required for person-to-person spread.</p><p><em>Shigella</em> gastroenteritis presents abruptly with <strong>high fever</strong>, intestinal <strong>cramping</strong>, and stools that are initially watery before <strong>mucus and/or blood</strong> appears.&nbsp; <em>Shigella</em> preferentially involves the <strong>rectosigmoid</strong> region (ie, left lower quadrant), causing frequent, small-volume but bloody/mucoid diarrhea; <strong>tenesmus</strong> is also common.&nbsp; <strong>Seizure</strong> is a severe complication that can occur in <strong>children</strong> with <em>Shigella</em> infection.&nbsp; The seizure may be provoked by fever from the infection (ie, febrile seizure) or caused by enterotoxins produced by the organism itself.&nbsp; Other potential complications of <em>Shigella</em> include rectal prolapse (due to severe rectal inflammation), bacteremia (associated with increased fatality), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).</p><p>Diagnosis is confirmed by stool culture, and treatment involves supportive care (eg, rehydration), as well as antibiotic therapy for symptomatic patients.&nbsp; Symptoms typically resolve within a week.&nbsp; In contrast to <em>E coli</em> O157:H7 diarrhea, in shigellosis, antibiotics do not increase the risk of HUS.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Clostridium perfringens and</em> enterotoxigenic <em>E coli</em> cause watery, nonbloody diarrhea.&nbsp; High-grade fever and associated seizures are unusual with these infections.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"2380\">Intussusception</a> can be a rare complication of viral gastroenteritis.&nbsp; Gastroenteritis symptoms may include watery diarrhea, fever, and seizures if dehydration is severe, whereas telescoping of bowel segments (ie, intussusception) due to hypertrophy of Peyer patches in the terminal ileum can result in episodic abdominal pain and bloody stools.&nbsp; However, ileal involvement causes right, not left, lower quadrant pain.&nbsp; In addition, a sausage-shaped abdominal mass is often palpable but is not present in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Ulcerative colitis, which is rare in children age &lt;5, can cause abdominal pain, fever, and bloody diarrhea.&nbsp; However, symptom onset is typically gradual, and seizures are not seen.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Gastroenteritis caused by <em>Shigella sonnei</em> presents acutely with high fever, abdominal cramping, and mucoid and/or bloody diarrhea.&nbsp; It may be associated with seizures in children.</p>",

In addition, her <a href=\"1312\">CT scan</a> is suggestive of air in the deep tissue.&nbsp; This constellation of findings is concerning for <strong>necrotizing fasciitis</strong>.&nbsp; Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading infection involving the subcutaneous fascia, generally following trauma.&nbsp; It can also result from significant peripheral vascular disease (ie, diabetes).&nbsp; Group A streptococci is the most frequently recovered pathogen, although necrotizing fasciitis is usually polymicrobial.&nbsp; Gas production by microbes leads to air in the soft tissues, which results in <strong>crepitus</strong> on examination in about <strong>50%</strong> of cases.</p><p>Patients with necrotizing fasciitis have pain and swelling of the affected site.&nbsp; The pain is frequently more severe than expected based on the degree of swelling and erythema and usually precedes systemic signs such as fever or hypotension.&nbsp; Untreated necrotizing fasciitis progresses to rapid discoloration of the affected site, purulent discharge, bullae, and necrosis.&nbsp; Imaging can reveal the extent of the infection and identify air in the tissue bed.&nbsp; However, if necrotizing fasciitis is strongly suspected, therapy should not be delayed to pursue additional imaging.&nbsp; Broad-spectrum <strong>antibiotic</strong> therapy and <strong>resection</strong> of necrotic tissue are necessary for treatment.&nbsp; Because of its rapid progression, necrotizing fasciitis causes significant morbidity and mortality even with aggressive treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Skin and soft-tissue infections that are successfully limited by the immune system and tissue barriers present as abscesses.&nbsp; Abscesses are localized to a tender, fluctuant area and do not spread aggressively as does necrotizing fasciitis.&nbsp; Systemic signs such as hypotension and high fever are unusual.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cellulitis is an acute skin infection that presents with warmth, erythema, edema, and tenderness.&nbsp; Evidence of underlying tissue necrosis, including severe pain or crepitus or systemic signs such as hypotension, should raise concern for a more aggressive process such as necrotizing fasciitis or other deep-tissue infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Deep-muscle hematomas can occur with moderate to severe trauma.&nbsp; Deep hematomas that arise with minor trauma are not commonly seen except in patients with bleeding disorders.&nbsp; Hematomas may be tender to palpation, but signs of infection such as erythema, fever, and hypotension are not consistent with hematoma.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Pyomyositis (muscle abscess) may have a very similar clinical presentation compared to necrotizing fasciitis, with fever, erythema, swelling, and pain.&nbsp; However, pyomyositis is generally limited to one muscle group and does not spread rapidly.&nbsp; This patient also has air in the tissue planes on CT scan, which is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Thrombophlebitis is characterized by erythema, tenderness, and swelling of the distal extremity along with a palpable, &#x22;cord-like&#x22; vein.&nbsp; Findings of tissue necrosis or shock are inconsistent with thrombophlebitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by diffuse erythematous skin rash and hypotension followed by multi-organ dysfunction.&nbsp; The rash of toxic shock syndrome is neither localized nor painful.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Necrotizing fasciitis presents with erythema and swelling, severe pain out of proportion to the physical examination, and signs of tissue necrosis such as crepitus, purulent drainage, or radiographic evidence of gas in the deep tissues.&nbsp; When skin or soft-tissue infection is suspected, rapid progression of physical examination findings or severe systemic signs such as hypotension should raise suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis.</p>",
