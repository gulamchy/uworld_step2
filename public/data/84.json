Infants are prone to miliaria rubra because their eccrine sweat glands within the epidermis are not fully developed or have delayed patency.&nbsp; As a result, <strong>hot or humid environments</strong> lead to sweat accumulation within the glands and an inflammatory reaction.</p><p>Clinical manifestations include a fine (2-4 mm), <a href=\"45883\">erythematous, papular rash</a>, as seen in this patient.&nbsp; It is typically located in <strong>intertriginous areas</strong> (eg, groin, axilla, anterior neck) or in areas where the skin is <strong>occluded</strong> (eg, back, head) by clothing, hats, or adhesive bandages.&nbsp; The rash is typically asymptomatic but may be pruritic, and infants are otherwise well appearing.</p><p>Management involves <strong>avoidance of overbundling</strong> and synthetic fabrics and switching to <strong>thin clothing</strong> made of breathable material (eg, cotton).&nbsp; Overheating and sweating can also be reduced by creating a <strong>cooler environment</strong> (eg, air conditioning, fan) when possible.&nbsp; If the rash is severe or associated with pruritus, topical low/mid-potency corticosteroids may be used as adjunctive therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; High-potency topical corticosteroids are not typically recommended in neonates due to the risk of systemic absorption enhanced by the thin stratum corneum in this age group.&nbsp; Moreover, absorption is further increased when applied to large, occluded areas, as is typically seen in miliaria rubra.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Topical antihistamines improve histamine-mediated pruritus, such as urticaria.&nbsp; In contrast to this patient&#39;s rash, <a href=\"4766\">urticaria</a> presents with raised, erythematous wheals.&nbsp; Moreover, the inflammatory response in miliaria rubra is not histamine mediated.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Cutaneous candidiasis, which can be treated with topical nystatin, usually affects the intertriginous areas, not the back.&nbsp; Moreover, the rash is characterized by beefy-red plaques with satellite erythematous papules, which are absent in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Reassurance alone is appropriate for erythema toxicum neonatorum, which classically presents as a maculopapular rash that evolves into pustules on an <a href=\"45884\">erythematous base</a>.&nbsp; This rash develops in the first 2-3 days of life and resolves by age 1 week, which is inconsistent with this patient&#39;s history.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Miliaria rubra is a fine, erythematous, papular eruption that classically develops in infants exposed to hot or humid environments and affects the intertriginous areas or areas under occlusion.&nbsp; Management involves avoidance of overheating by use of thin, cotton clothing and placement in a cool environment when possible.</p>",
