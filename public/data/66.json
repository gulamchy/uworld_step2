Differentiation requires iron studies, but empiric iron supplementation is sometimes prescribed.&nbsp; Lack of improvement in hemoglobin levels within 4 weeks makes iron deficiency unlikely <strong>(Choice I)</strong>.&nbsp; Therefore, this patient likely has <strong>thalassemia</strong>, a genetic disorder with <strong>hemoglobin defects</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"19042\">Hemoglobin A</a>, the major form of hemoglobin in children and adults, contains 2 alpha-globins and 2 beta-globins.&nbsp; Transcription of the 4 alpha-globin and 2 beta-globin genes is tightly regulated (eg, specific ratio of alpha-/beta-globin production).&nbsp; In thalassemia, mutations or deletions to &#8805;1 of these genes alter the ratio of alpha-/beta-globin synthesis.&nbsp; Precipitation of excess unpaired globin chains results in erythrocyte toxicity in the bone marrow (ineffective hematopoiesis) and bloodstream (hemolysis).</p><p>Thalassemia severity depends on the number of <a href=\"389\">globin chains affected</a>.&nbsp; Defects in 1 or 2 of the alpha-globin chains (alpha-thalassemia minima or minor) or 1 of the beta-globin chains (beta-thalassemia minor) often cause minimal symptoms.&nbsp; Thalassemia minor is associated with mild/moderate <strong>reductions in hematocrit</strong> (&gt;28%) and <strong>low MCV</strong> (55-75 &micro;m<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Aplastic anemia (multipotent hematopoietic stem cell injury) and bone marrow infiltration (eg, myelofibrosis, metastatic cancer) are usually associated with pancytopenia and normocytic or macrocytic erythrocytes.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and K)</strong>&nbsp; Circulating antibodies to erythrocyte membranes and traumatic hemolysis (eg, erythrocyte shearing on artificial heart valves) can cause hemolytic anemia, usually associated with normocytic anemia and, sometimes, manifestations of hyperbilirubinemia (eg, icterus).</p><p><strong>(Choices D and F)</strong>&nbsp; Cobalamin (vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>) or folate deficiency leads to macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Erythropoietin promotes erythrocyte differentiation and maturation.&nbsp; Deficiency, most commonly seen in renal failure, is associated with normocytic anemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice H)</strong>&nbsp; Hereditary spherocytosis is associated with hemolytic anemia due to an erythrocyte membrane defect.&nbsp; MCV is low (small erythrocyte size from the membrane defect), but MCHC is elevated (&gt;36% Hb/cell) due to the increased hemoglobin:cell membrane ratio.</p><p><strong>(Choice J)</strong>&nbsp; Deficiency in erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase leads to oxidative injury and subsequent hemolytic anemia.&nbsp; MCV and MCHC are usually normal.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>The 2 most common causes of microcytic anemia, iron deficiency and thalassemia, are differentiated by iron studies.&nbsp; Thalassemia is a hemoglobin defect caused by alterations to &#8805;1 of the hemoglobin globin subunits.&nbsp; Thalassemia minor is minimally symptomatic.</p>",

Intravascular hemolysis is due to significant RBC structural damage resulting in RBC destruction within the intravascular space (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation).&nbsp; The hemoglobin released from hemolyzed RBCs binds to haptoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is cleared by the liver.&nbsp; This leads to markedly reduced serum haptoglobin (to undetectable levels).&nbsp; RBC hemolysis also results in elevated indirect bilirubin levels (from heme breakdown) and raised serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (released from RBCs).</p><p>In <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>, the RBCs are predominantly destroyed by phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system (eg, lymph nodes, spleen).&nbsp; As a result, there is less hemoglobin release than in intravascular hemolysis, so laboratory results usually show normal to slightly low haptoglobin, slightly elevated LDH, and elevated indirect bilirubin.&nbsp; Extravascular hemolysis can be due to causes such as antibody-mediated RBC destruction (eg, most cases of AIHA) or intrinsic RBC enzyme (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) or membrane (eg, hereditary spherocytosis) defects.</p><p>This patient&#39;s laboratory findings (anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, low-normal haptoglobin, and slightly elevated LDH) all suggest extravascular hemolysis; her peripheral smear shows <a href=\"1369\">spherocytes</a> without central pallor.&nbsp; These findings can be seen in AIHA as well as in hereditary spherocytosis.&nbsp; AIHA usually has a negative family history and <strong>positive Coombs</strong> test.&nbsp; Hereditary spherocytosis usually has a strong family history and a negative Coombs test.&nbsp; If the Coombs test is negative and there is still a high index of suspicion for AIHA, a micro-Coombs test can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; This patient most likely has <a href=\"1368\">warm-agglutinin (IgG autoantibody mediated-) AIHA</a> from an autoimmune cause.&nbsp; AIHA usually causes extravascular hemolysis, although some degree of intravascular hemolysis can occur, especially with IgM-mediated AIHA.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked hereditary cause of hemolytic anemia in which hemolytic episodes may be triggered by medications (eg, sulfa drugs).&nbsp; Peripheral blood smear may show cells with Heinz bodies.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hereditary spherocytosis usually has a strong family history (most cases are autosomal dominant), positive eosin-5-maleimide (and osmotic fragility) test, and a negative Coombs test.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by a defect in the cell membrane anchor that leads to complement-mediated hemolysis with a negative Coombs test but evidence of venous thrombosis and sometimes episodic intravascular hemolysis.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Sickle cell anemia is usually associated with a strong family history and sickle-shaped cells on peripheral blood smear.&nbsp; Splenomegaly may be seen in childhood, but autosplenectomy is a more common finding by adulthood.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and hereditary spherocytosis (HS) can cause extravascular hemolytic anemia.&nbsp; A negative family history and positive Coombs test suggest AIHA; a positive family history and negative Coombs test suggest HS.&nbsp; The peripheral blood smear in both conditions may show spherocytes without central pallor.</p>",

<strong>Pregnancy</strong> is associated with an increased number of pain episodes, especially in the third trimester.&nbsp; This is because physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, increased metabolic demand) promote hemoglobin polymerization and sickle formation; in addition, maintenance medications (eg, hydroxyurea) are often stopped by patients due to fear of fetal toxicity.</p><p>This patient&#39;s severe nausea/vomiting (eg, ketonuria, elevated amylase and transaminase levels) is the likely triggering factor for this pain episode.&nbsp; The <strong>low hemoglobin</strong>, <strong>elevated reticulocyte count</strong>, and <strong>bilirubin</strong> provide evidence of chronic hemolysis characteristic of SCD.&nbsp; Fetal heart rate decelerations are expected during a crisis (due to decreased fetal oxygenation and perfusion) and resolve as the mother&#39;s condition stabilizes.</p><p>Treatment of a <strong>vasoocclusive pain episode</strong> in pregnant patients is similar to that in nonpregnant patients: <strong>intravenous (IV) hydration</strong> and <strong>aggressive pain control</strong> (eg, morphine patient-controlled analgesia).&nbsp; Prompt and sufficient pain control with opioids is critical for relieving pain while its precipitating cause is treated.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; After appropriate IV hydration and pain control, imaging can be considered if there are no signs of improvement or obvious triggers of the painful episode.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Magnesium sulfate is used in preeclampsia with severe features and HELLP (<strong>H</strong>emolysis, <strong>E</strong>levated <strong>L</strong>iver enzymes, <strong>L</strong>ow <strong>P</strong>latelets) syndrome.&nbsp; Although hemolysis is present, the transaminases are only mildly elevated and the platelet count is normal, making HELLP syndrome unlikely.&nbsp; Preeclampsia is marked by hypertension (blood pressure &#8805;140/90 mm Hg), proteinuria, and signs of end-organ damage (eg, elevated creatinine and transaminase levels).&nbsp; This patient does not meet blood pressure or laboratory criteria for <a href=\"4657\">preeclampsia</a>.&nbsp; Delivery is curative in HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia; however, the associated blood loss can exacerbate an acute pain episode.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ketorolac) are generally avoided in SCD because of the risk for acute and chronic renal injury.&nbsp; In addition, they are avoided in pregnancy after 32 weeks gestation due to the risk for premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pregnancy is associated with an increase in vasoocclusive pain episodes in patients with sickle cell disease due to physiologic changes.&nbsp; Each episode is treated with aggressive pain control and intravenous hydration during treatment of the precipitating causes.</p>",

Peripheral blood smear typically shows immature red blood cells (eg, normoblasts) and <a href=\"34077\">spherocytes</a> due to the partial removal of erythrocyte membrane by splenic macrophages.&nbsp;

Although PV is often discovered incidentally on routine laboratory testing, patients may have <strong>aquagenic pruritus</strong> (itching worse with water), erythromelalgia (burning in feet/hands), transient vision disturbances (from hyperviscosity), or complications related to <strong>thrombosis</strong>/hemorrhage.&nbsp; The etiology of some of these findings is unclear, but improvement in pruritus and erythromelalgia with aspirin may reflect a causative role for prostaglandins (which are pruritogenic).</p><p>Risk of venous and arterial thrombosis is significantly increased in PV due to increased blood viscosity and abnormalities in platelet and leukocyte function.&nbsp; One classic thrombotic complication is <strong>Budd-Chiari syndrome</strong>, a disorder marked by hepatic venous outflow obstruction (usually due to hepatic vein thrombosis).&nbsp; Manifestations may be acute, subacute, or chronic; subacute cases often present with progressive <strong>abdominal discomfort</strong>, <strong>ascites</strong> (eg, abdominal distension, flank dullness), and <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong> (this may also be caused by PV directly).&nbsp; Mild/moderate elevations in liver transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase also commonly occur.</p><p>The diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome is established with noninvasive imaging such as <strong>abdominal Doppler ultrasonography</strong>, which typically shows abnormal hepatic blood flow, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites.&nbsp; Patients with suspected PV (as in this case) should also undergo blood testing for the <em>JAK2</em> V617F mutation, which is almost always positive.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection often leads to cirrhosis, which frequently causes ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated bilirubin/transaminases.&nbsp; However, significant polycythemia, aquagenic pruritis, and facial plethora would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Diagnostic paracentesis can help identify spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which usually presents with abdominal pain, fever, and hepatic encephalopathy.&nbsp; Almost all cases occur in those with underlying advanced cirrhosis; polycythemia, aquagenic pruritis, and facial plethora indicate an alternate diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; MR cholangiopancreatography can identify biliary tree or pancreatic head lesions.&nbsp; Although biliary obstruction can cause elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, it would not account for the aquagenic pruritis, facial plethora, and polycythemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Approximately 50% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels.&nbsp; Although hepatocellular carcinoma can present with abdominal pain, mild/moderate polycythemia (due to ectopic erythropoietin production), and decompensated cirrhosis, most cases arise in those with chronic viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse.&nbsp; In addition, the presence of aquagenic pruritis, severe polycythemia (HCT &gt; 60%), and facial plethora make PV far more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy is generally indicated when patients have cirrhosis from unclear causes or a liver lesion that cannot be diagnosed with imaging.&nbsp; This patient needs abdominal imaging prior to considering a biopsy.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Budd-Chiari syndrome, a condition marked by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, often presents with subacute manifestations such as vague, progressive abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly.&nbsp; Polycythemia vera, a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with increased red blood cell mass, is particularly likely to cause Budd-Chiari syndrome.</p>",
