Similar to Crohn disease (CD), most patients develop UC between age 15 and 40, although it can be diagnosed at any age.&nbsp; UC is characterized by chronic idiopathic inflammation of the rectum and other portions of the colon with intermittent exacerbations.&nbsp; Patients commonly have abdominal pain, <strong>bloody diarrhea</strong>, tenesmus, fecal incontinence, fever, and, in severe cases, weight loss.&nbsp; <strong>Inflammatory arthritis</strong>, as seen in this patient, is a common extraintestinal manifestation of both UC and CD, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) used to treat arthritis symptoms may worsen underlying bowel inflammation.</p><p>Laboratory findings in UC can include leukocytosis, anemia (mixed iron deficiency and chronic disease), reactive thrombocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate).&nbsp; Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy typically demonstrates <strong>erythematous</strong> and <strong>friable mucosa</strong> with <strong>ulcers</strong>; the lesions are usually <strong>continuous</strong> and circumferential (unlike in CD).&nbsp; Biopsy shows inflammation limited to the mucosa and submucosa (compared to transmural inflammation in CD).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Amebic dysentery presents with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, but exudative ulcerations and skip lesions (as opposed to continuous inflammation) are usually seen.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s flexible sigmoidoscopy findings are more consistent with UC.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is classically associated with pseudomembranes on endoscopy.&nbsp; It usually causes pancolitis, presents with watery diarrhea, and occurs most commonly in patients with a history of recent antibiotic use.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although weight loss, bloody stools, and anemia can be seen in colon cancer, this patient&#39;s flexible sigmoidoscopy findings are highly suggestive of UC, which also explains these findings.&nbsp; Furthermore, this patient had a normal colonoscopy 4 years ago, making colon cancer less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with chronic colonic ischemia or small vessel vasculitis can have bloody diarrhea and weight loss and may be initially misdiagnosed with UC.&nbsp; However, involvement of the rectum, which has a dual blood supply, makes atherosclerotic ischemic colitis less likely (<a href=\"3693\">watershed areas</a> at the splenic flexure or rectosigmoid junction are usually affected).&nbsp; In addition, this patient&#39;s lack of other findings of small vessel inflammation (eg, skin, pulmonary, or renal involvement) reduces the likelihood of vasculitis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Ulcerative colitis most commonly develops between ages 15 and 40, but it can be diagnosed at any age.&nbsp; Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and fecal incontinence.&nbsp; Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrates continuous colonic involvement with ulcers and erythematous, friable mucosa.</p>",

FPIAP is a non&ndash;IgE-mediated reaction that usually occurs in response to proteins in <strong>cow&#39;s milk</strong> (eg, casein, whey), such as those in standard formula.&nbsp; Because <strong>breast milk</strong> contains proteins derived from the maternal diet, FPIAP can also occur in breastfed infants.</p><p>Disease onset is insidious, and symptoms often do not arise until weeks (most commonly at <strong>age 1-4 weeks</strong>) to months (up to age 6 months) after first exposure to the food allergen.&nbsp; The typical presentation involves a <strong>well-appearing infant</strong> with <strong>painless bloody stools</strong> that may also be loose and mucus streaked.&nbsp; Symptoms suggestive of a different diagnosis include failure to thrive, profuse diarrhea, and forceful vomiting; this patient&#39;s spit-up likely results from physiologic gastroesophageal reflux.</p><p>FPIAP is a clinical diagnosis and is confirmed when bleeding ceases after the trigger protein is removed from the diet.&nbsp; The prognosis is excellent, and patients usually can tolerate products containing the offending protein (eg, milk, yogurt) by age 1.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although antibiotics, a risk factor for <em>Clostridioides</em> (formerly <em>Clostridium</em>) <em>difficile</em> colitis, may be transmitted through breast milk, <em>C difficile</em> infection is rare in infants, who lack the intestinal receptors to the toxin until approximately age 2.&nbsp; Moreover, other infectious symptoms (eg, fever, profuse diarrhea) would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"2380\">Intussusception</a> occurs in infants and toddlers age 6-36 months.&nbsp; It presents with lethargy, vomiting, and episodic, crampy pain/irritability as one bowel segment telescopes into another.&nbsp; Hematochezia is a late sign and indicates bowel ischemia.&nbsp; This infant&#39;s age and lack of irritability make intussusception unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Lactose intolerance, typically diagnosed in older children and adults, is a nonimmunologic reaction to carbohydrate components of cow&#39;s milk due to lactase deficiency.&nbsp; Symptoms include crampy abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and nonbloody diarrhea.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"41237\">Malrotation with midgut volvulus</a> can cause bloody stools due to intestinal ischemia.&nbsp; However, affected neonates are ill appearing with bilious emesis and poor appetite.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Although <a href=\"504\">Meckel diverticulum</a> classically manifests in older children as painless hematochezia due to ectopic gastric tissue, bleeding in patients age &lt;6 months is exceedingly rare and typically is associated with complications (eg, obstruction, perforation, intussusception).&nbsp; Ill appearance and irritability due to pain would be typical in these cases and are not seen here.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Food protein&ndash;induced allergic proctocolitis is a common, benign reaction to proteins (eg, cow&#39;s milk) in breast milk or formula.&nbsp; Presentation involves a well-appearing infant with painless, bloody stools.</p>",
