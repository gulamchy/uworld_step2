Infusion protocols (eg, units/hr, mL/hr, units/kg/hr) may differ even within the same hospital, necessitating dose conversions and increasing risk of <strong>mathematical error</strong>.</p><p>Human factors engineering (HFE) reduces error risk by designing processes responsive to expected human behaviors.&nbsp; According to the <strong>HFE hierarchy of effectiveness</strong>, strategies that remove or greatly <strong>reduce human effort </strong>for correct action are most effective.&nbsp; Infusion pumps with dosing algorithms and preset limits (ie, <strong>&#x22;smart pumps&#x22;</strong>) apply the most effective HFE strategies to reduce heparin-associated errors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Computerized automation</strong> replaces human effort with technology to reduce harmful process variation.&nbsp; Dosing <strong>algorithm software</strong> automates conversion between infusion protocols, preventing mathematical errors.&nbsp; Automation is appropriate for constant, predictable processes (eg, constant heparin infusion on a hospital floor) but is less suitable for dynamic processes requiring critical analysis and frequent adjustments (eg, administering heparin boluses in an operating room).</p></li><li><p><strong>Forcing functions</strong> are <strong>hard stops</strong> in a design or process that eliminate the risk of incorrect action.&nbsp; Preconfigured dose limits represent a hard stop blocking infusion of excessive heparin doses.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choices A, B, C, and D)</strong>&nbsp; HFE strategies requiring greater human effort for correct action are comparatively less effective than forcing functions and automation, including:</p><ul><li><p>Checklists (eg, reviewing list of sterile precautions prior to central line insertion)</p></li><li><p>&#x22;Forced pauses&#x22; or time-out (eg, prior to surgery to verify procedure and patient)</p></li><li><p>Double-checks (eg, requiring 2 providers to calculate an infusion dose)</p></li><li><p>Organizational policy change, including promoting shared governance (eg, employee involvement in structuring organizational culture)</p></li></ul><p>Although these strategies are important and do reduce error risk, they are vulnerable to human factors such as confirmation bias (eg, tendency to interpret information toward an anticipated outcome, such as believing all items on a checklist are complete) and workarounds (bypassing protocols to increase efficiency, such as skipping certain components of a time-out to expedite a procedure).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>According to human factors engineering, the most effective error-prevention strategies include computerized automation and forcing functions, which promote correct action with minimal human effort.&nbsp; An example is a heparin infusion pump with dosing algorithms (automating mathematical conversions) and preset limits (&#x22;blocking&#x22; excess drug administration).</p>",

            "questionText": "<p>A 16-year-old girl comes to the office for an initial patient visit.&nbsp; Medical conditions include asthma and mild acne.&nbsp; The patient does not smoke or use illicit drugs regularly but has tried alcohol and marijuana at parties a few times.&nbsp; She is not sexually active.&nbsp; The patient maintains average grades at school.&nbsp; When asked about extracurricular activities, she says that she is thinking about quitting her high school softball team because &#x22;the other girls are mean, and I just don&#39;t enjoy playing anymore.&#x22;&nbsp; When asked to describe how she feels, the patient hesitantly mentions that she gets depressed at times and frequently feels self-conscious and that no one likes her.&nbsp; She appears uncomfortable and nervously asks the physician, &#x22;You won&#39;t say anything about this to my parents, will you?&#x22;&nbsp; Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient?</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p><strong>Protecting</strong> the <strong>adolescent&#39;s confidentiality</strong> is important to maintaining a <strong>trusting patient-physician relationship</strong> for discussions of sensitive topics, such as mental health, drug use, and sexuality.&nbsp; At the initial visit, physicians should prepare adolescents and guardians for increasing adolescent autonomy in health care decisions while promoting open communication between the parties.&nbsp; This discussion should also include situations in which the physician is ethically or legally bound to breach confidentiality <strong>(conditional confidentiality)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Limitations to adolescent confidentiality</strong> include determinations of <strong>imminent risk</strong> (eg, suicidality, homicidality) and <strong>threats to safety</strong> (eg, sexually abusive relationships, intoxicated driving).&nbsp; Additional risks to confidentiality should also be discussed with adolescent patients, including guardian access to information through the electronic medical record and patient portal, direct medical record requests, and insurance/billing statements.</p><p>When confidentiality must be breached, it should be discussed first with the adolescent, who should be given the option to broach the topic with the guardian.&nbsp; In this case, although the patient does not describe an imminent threat to her well-being, the physician should take the opportunity to set the framework for their future patient-physician relationship.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Establishing rapport and maintaining privacy with adolescents supports positive health practices, but there are circumstances that require disclosure to guardians (eg, imminent risk, recurrent safety concerns), to state protective agencies (eg, abuse, neglect), or to health departments (eg, transmissible infections).&nbsp; Keeping everything &#x22;between you and me only&#x22; (unconditional confidentiality) undermines the physician&#39;s duties to practice in the patient&#39;s best interest (beneficence) and to do no harm (nonmaleficence).</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; The physician is not obligated to divulge information to this patient&#39;s parents or to respond to questions about what the adolescent discusses unless there are significant health or safety concerns.&nbsp; If no sense of privacy can be expected, adolescents may avoid future health care interactions and may not pursue necessary health care interventions.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Although the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) addresses provider responsibilities regarding patient confidentiality practices, it does not ensure unconditional confidentiality for adolescents or expressly prohibit guardians from lawfully accessing sensitive information via record request.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Having an early, open discussion about confidentiality and its exceptions (eg, imminent risk, safety, legal mandates) with adolescents and guardians establishes a transparent framework for future patient-physician interactions.&nbsp; It also provides guidance on appropriate progression of adolescent health care autonomy while allowing for the promotion of open communication.</p>",
