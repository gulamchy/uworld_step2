Severe <strong>intoxication</strong> may manifest with features of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>sympathomimetic toxicity:</strong> hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia.</p></li><li><p>serotonin toxicity: <a href=\"973\">serotonin syndrome</a> (eg, altered mental status, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, seizures) and <strong>hyponatremia</strong> (due to drug-induced inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as well as excessive water intake to reduce hyperthermia).</p></li></ul><p>Combining MDMA with other serotonergic drugs (eg, sertraline), as in this patient, further increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.&nbsp; Coma and death may result from acute intoxication, and long-term use has been linked to neurotoxicity.&nbsp; Recreational synthetic amphetamines and analogues (eg, MDMA, bath salts) may not show up as amphetamines in routine urine toxicology screens.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may include tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, delirium, and seizures, but myoclonus is not expected.&nbsp; In addition, this patient drinks alcohol only occasionally, making withdrawal less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cannabis intoxication can cause tachycardia and hypertension but typically not hyperthermia; neurologic manifestations (eg, slurred speech and ataxia) may also result, but seizures, myoclonus, or hyperreflexia are usually not seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Diphenhydramine overdose leading to <a href=\"3444\">anticholinergic toxicity</a> can cause bizarre behavior, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, and seizures.&nbsp; However, affected patients typically have anhidrosis and decreased bowel sounds, whereas this patient is diaphoretic with increased bowel sounds.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Nitrous oxide is an inhalant sometimes misused for its euphoric and calming properties.&nbsp; It can cause loss of consciousness and seizures (with significant overdoses), but elevated vital signs, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and hyponatremia are not expected.&nbsp; In addition, its effects typically last only 15-45 minutes.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication most often induces severe agitation, psychosis, and aggressive behavior rather than somnolence.&nbsp; Although seizures can occur with large overdoses, they are not typical.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>MDMA is a synthetic amphetamine that can cause euphoria and increased sociability, empathy, and sexual desire.&nbsp; Because it increases synaptic levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, intoxication may manifest with sympathomimetic toxicity (eg, tachycardia, hypertension) and serotonin syndrome (eg, seizures, myoclonus).&nbsp; Use with other serotonergic drugs greatly increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.</p>",

PCP acts on the following:</p><ul><li><p>NMDA receptors, particularly in the hippocampus and limbic system (causing excitatory and psychotic effects)</p></li><li><p>Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors (causing adrenergic and dopaminergic effects)</p></li><li><p>The sigma receptor complex (causing psychotic and anticholinergic effects)</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, PCP intoxication commonly presents with severe <strong>agitation, delusions</strong> of enhanced strength, psychosis (eg, paranoia, <strong>hallucinations</strong>), analgesia, and aggression.&nbsp; Physical examination findings include <strong>multidirectional nystagmus</strong> (horizontal, vertical, and/or rotary), hypertension, tachycardia, and <strong>disorientation</strong>.&nbsp; Severe cases may present with hyperthermia, ataxia, muscle rigidity, seizures, and coma.</p><p>The treatment of PCP intoxication involves supportive management and control of agitation and aggression to maintain safety.&nbsp; <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> (eg, lorazepam, midazolam) are the preferred agents for managing PCP-associated agitation; <strong>lorazepam</strong> has a rapid onset of action, which allows for faster management of behavioral crises.&nbsp; In addition, the sedation achieved with benzodiazepines can help manage complications (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension) and protect against seizures.&nbsp; If there is an incomplete response to benzodiazepines, antipsychotics can be used as adjunctive treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that can be used in the management of serotonin syndrome.&nbsp; Muscular rigidity, delirium, hyperthermia, and abnormal eye movements are signs of serotonin syndrome; however, this patient&#39;s history of repeated hospitalizations due to substance use and significant aggression (ie, screaming, pounding on walls) make PCP intoxication more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dexmedetomidine is an agonist at the alpha-2 receptor that is commonly used in the intensive care unit and for procedural sedation.&nbsp; It is not typically used in the treatment of PCP intoxication.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that may be used in specific cases of hypertensive emergencies (eg, pheochromocytoma).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Urinary acidification, which increases PCP clearance, is no longer recommended as a treatment for PCP intoxication because it is largely ineffective&mdash;it increases clearance by only 1%&mdash;and increases the risk for acidosis and renal damage.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Phencyclidine intoxication presents with severe agitation, delusions of enhanced strength, psychosis, analgesia, multidirectional nystagmus, hypertension, tachycardia, and disorientation.&nbsp; Agitation and aggression can be managed with benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam).</p>",
