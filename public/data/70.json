Many patients develop complications of therapy due to the long duration of treatment with supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids.&nbsp; In addition to hyperglycemia and bone loss, treatment may be associated with glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM).&nbsp; GIM is one of the most common types of drug-induced myopathy and typically occurs weeks to months after starting glucocorticoid therapy.&nbsp; Acute myopathy following very high-dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy can occur in critically ill patients but is not as common as chronic myopathy complicating long-term glucocorticoid use.&nbsp; The mechanism is thought to be due to increased muscle catabolism and decreased anabolism as a direct effect of glucocorticoids.</p><p>This risk of GIM rises with higher doses of glucocorticoids (generally &gt;40 mg hydrocortisone daily or its equivalent).&nbsp; Patients typically develop <strong>painless</strong> proximal muscle <strong>weakness</strong> (lower extremity before upper extremity) that manifests as difficulty in daily activities such as getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, or brushing hair.&nbsp; There is no muscle inflammation or tenderness, and creatine kinase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are normal.&nbsp; Muscle power improves after discontinuation of glucocorticoids, but recovery can take weeks to months.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Inflammatory myositis can present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness.&nbsp; However, the muscles are generally tender on palpation and creatine kinase and ESR levels are usually elevated.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Mononeuritis multiplex is usually seen in vasculitis and is caused by nerve damage in 2 or more nerves in separate parts of the body.&nbsp; Patients typically develop asymmetric peripheral nerve findings such as wrist or foot drop.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Multiple sclerosis typically presents with 2 or more episodes of various neurologic symptoms with interval resolution rather than chronic/progressive symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Neuromuscular junction diseases such as myasthenia gravis may cause proximal muscle weakness.&nbsp; However, they usually cause more upper- than lower-extremity disease and usually have associated ocular symptoms.&nbsp; Muscle weakness is typically fluctuating; more muscle weakness is observed later in the day and following exercise.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Polymyalgia rheumatica can be seen in up to 50% of patients with temporal arteritis.&nbsp; Patients typically complain of aching and morning stiffness, with pain and decreased range of motion in the shoulders, neck, and hip girdle.&nbsp; Patients have objectively <strong>normal muscle strength</strong>.&nbsp; The ESR is usually elevated &gt;40 mm/hr.&nbsp; <strong>Symptoms improve rapidly (in days) with glucocorticoids</strong>, and ESR usually returns to normal in a few weeks.&nbsp; Creatine kinase is normal in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Symmetric polyneuropathies are characterized by paresthesias and predominantly distal, rather than proximal, muscle weakness.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy is a complication of chronic corticosteroid use.&nbsp; It is characterized by painless proximal muscle weakness, which is more prominent in the lower extremities.&nbsp; There is no muscle inflammation or tenderness, and creatine kinase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are normal.&nbsp; Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy slowly improves once the offending medication is discontinued.</p>",

In a patient age &#8805;50, this presentation suggests&nbsp;<strong>giant cell arteritis</strong> (GCA; also referred to as <strong>temporal arteritis</strong>), a chronic vasculitis affecting medium and large vessels.&nbsp; Systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever, weight loss) are common, and about half of patients have concurrent polymyalgia rheumatica, which presents with proximal muscle pain and stiffness.&nbsp; In addition to <strong>headaches</strong>&nbsp;(often temporal) and <strong>visual symptoms</strong>,&nbsp;other common manifestations of GCA include jaw claudication, thickening and tenderness along the temporal artery (eg, lateral scalp), and asymmetric loss of distal pulses.</p><p>Vision loss is the most dreaded complication of GCA; most patients experience transient monocular vision loss (ie, amaurosis fugax) prior to developing permanent vision loss.&nbsp; <strong>Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</strong> (AION), the most common ocular manifestation, occurs due to partial or complete occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery and is characterized by a <strong>pale, edematous disc with blurred margins</strong>.</p><p>Threatened (eg, vision change) or confirmed vision loss in GCA requires <strong>high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids</strong> (eg, methylprednisolone 500-1,000 mg daily), followed by oral therapy with a slow taper over several months to prevent worsening or contralateral vision loss.&nbsp; Temporal artery biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of GCA; however, therapy should be started immediately when the diagnosis is suspected and should not be withheld while awaiting confirmation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Acetazolamide is used to treat angle-closure glaucoma, which presents with acute vision loss and headache.&nbsp; However, patients frequently have ocular pain, nausea, and vomiting.&nbsp; Examination findings include conjunctival erythema, corneal opacity, and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Low-dose glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone 10-20 mg daily) are recommended for polymyalgia rheumatica without GCA.&nbsp; Higher dose oral prednisone (40-60 mg/day) is appropriate for uncomplicated GCA without signs of end-organ damage.&nbsp; However, this patient has acute vision loss and warrants aggressive treatment with parenteral glucocorticoids.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Sumatriptan is indicated for acute treatment of migraine headache, which can be associated with visual aura.&nbsp; However, unilateral headaches associated with nausea and photosensitivity are typical, and AION would not occur.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Thrombolytic therapy is indicated for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, which typically presents with focal neurologic deficits (eg, hemiparesis, aphasia), not AION.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Giant cell arteritis (GCA, or temporal arteritis) presents with headache and systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever) in patients age &#8805;50.&nbsp; Potential complications include anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which can lead to blindness.&nbsp; Threatened (eg, vision change) or confirmed vision loss in GCA requires high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids.</p>",
