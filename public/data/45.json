Following <a href=\"12866\">acute management</a> of NSTEMI, <strong>long-term medical therapy</strong> is aimed at preventing recurrent coronary events (secondary prevention) and improving survival.&nbsp; Medical therapy shown to improve outcomes after myocardial infarction (MI) includes beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, and aspirin.&nbsp; Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) are also beneficial following MI in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure symptoms or comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In addition, <strong>dual antiplatelet therapy</strong> (DAPT) with low-dose aspirin and a P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> receptor blocker (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) decreases the risk of recurrent ischemic events and improves survival following MI.&nbsp; Therefore, DAPT is recommend for 1 year following MI, regardless of whether a coronary stent is placed.&nbsp; In the case of coronary stenting, DAPT for up to 12 months is critical in preventing recurrent ischemic events due to acute stent thrombosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) are occasionally used as adjunctive therapy (in addition to nitrates and beta blockers) in patients with stable angina.&nbsp; However, they have not been shown to provide mortality benefit in patients with MI.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Anticoagulation (eg, with a heparin product, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor, or parenteral factor Xa inhibitor) is part of the initial acute management of NSTEMI, but long-term anticoagulation therapy is not typically given following MI in the absence of another indication (eg, atrial fibrillation).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Short-acting nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin) may be used in the initial, acute management of acute coronary syndrome to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and ischemic chest pain.&nbsp; Long-acting nitrates (eg, isosorbide mononitrate) are used in patients with persistent stable angina, but they are not indicated in asymptomatic patients following MI.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) are vasodilators used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.&nbsp; These drugs are not indicated following MI.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin and a P2Y<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> receptor blocker decreases the risk of recurrent ischemic events and cardiovascular death following myocardial infarction (MI), and is recommended for 12 months following MI regardless of whether a coronary stent is placed.&nbsp;
