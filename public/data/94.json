Administered prior to incision, prophylactic antibiotics reduce the microorganism burden at the surgical site and are indicated when there is a <strong>high risk of infection</strong> (eg, traumatic wounds) or when infection would <strong>cause significant morbidity</strong>/mortality (eg, mediastinitis after cardiac surgery).</p><p>The specific antibiotic is chosen based on several factors, including the type of surgical wound and its expected degree of microbial contamination:</p><ul><li>Clean &ndash; without infection or viscus entry</li><li>Clean-contaminated &ndash; with controlled viscus entry</li><li>Contaminated &ndash; inflamed, acutely traumatic, or with viscus spillage</li><li>Dirty &ndash; infected, necrotic, or fecally contaminated</li></ul><p>Cardiac procedures are typically considered clean, and most associated SSIs are due to skin flora.&nbsp; Therefore, only <strong>gram-positive skin flora</strong> (eg, <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, coagulase-negative <em>Staphylococcus</em>) coverage is required.&nbsp; <strong>First- and second-generation cephalosporins</strong> (eg, cefazolin) typically provide good prophylactic coverage.&nbsp; However, this patient has a history of a severe IgE-mediated allergic reaction (ie, anaphylactic shock) to penicillin, with which first- and second-generation cephalosporins have structural similarities (ie, shared allergenic epitopes).&nbsp; Therefore, an alternative antibiotic (eg, <strong>vancomycin</strong>, <strong>clindamycin</strong>) with good gram-positive coverage should be selected.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Azithromycin has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria including atypical bacteria (eg, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Legionella</em>); it is commonly used for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.&nbsp; It has inferior coverage against <em>Staphylococcus</em> and is not typically used for SSI prophylaxis.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; Ciprofloxacin has antimicrobial activity against aerobic, enteric, gram-negative bacilli and is used for prophylaxis in some genitourinary procedures.&nbsp; Metronidazole has antimicrobial activity against anaerobes (eg, <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Clostridium</em>) and protozoa (eg, <em>Trichomonas vaginalis)</em> and is used as part&nbsp;of a prophylaxis regimen in some gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and genitourinary procedures.&nbsp; However, neither antibiotic provides adequate coverage against typical gram-positive skin flora for this cardiac procedure.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Piperacillin-tazobactam has antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>; it is commonly used in broad-spectrum, empiric coverage for severe infections.&nbsp; However, such broad coverage is unnecessary (following principles of antimicrobial stewardship) for prophylaxis against a narrower spectrum of gram-positive skin flora.&nbsp; In addition, piperacillin-tazobactam should be avoided given this patient&#39;s severe penicillin allergy.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Prophylactic antibiotics reduce surgical site infections and are indicated when there is a high risk of infection or when infection would lead to significant morbidity/mortality.&nbsp;
