Gestational thrombocytopenia occurs in 5%-10% of pregnancies and is likely due to physiologic increases in plasma volume during pregnancy (ie, dilutional effect).&nbsp; It is commonly diagnosed in the <strong>third trimester</strong> on a routine complete blood count, as in this patient, but can arise as early as the first trimester.&nbsp; Patients are <strong>asymptomatic</strong> (ie, no bruising, bleeding, or anemia) or have normal physiologic symptoms of pregnancy, such as this patient&#39;s fatigue, shortness of breath, and symmetric leg swelling.</p><p>Patients with isolated, asymptomatic, and mild thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are assumed to have gestational thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; Because this condition does not affect obstetric or neonatal outcomes and because platelet counts usually normalize within 6 weeks of delivery (ie, self-limited), management includes <strong>reassurance and observation</strong>.&nbsp;
