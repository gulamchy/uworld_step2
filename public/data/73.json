Approximately 50% of cases are associated with an underlying malignancy, mostly <strong>small cell lung cancer</strong>.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s long smoking history and recent presentation with cough, weakness, low BMI, and a <a href=\"4705\">lung mass</a> on chest CT scan are concerning for malignancy.</p><p>Patients initially have progressive <strong>symmetric proximal limb muscle weakness</strong> (eg, standing from a chair, combing hair, putting dishes in overhead cabinets).&nbsp;

Patients should also be evaluated and treated for a primary underlying malignancy.&nbsp; Symptomatic therapy includes guanidine or 3,4-diaminopyridine to increase presynaptic acetylcholine levels.&nbsp;

Foot drop can be caused by any lesion along the motor pathway for foot dorsiflexion (eg, L5 root, lumbar plexus, sciatic nerve, common or deep fibular).&nbsp; The most common causes are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>L5 radiculopathy is typified by back pain radiating to the foot, often with weakness of foot eversion and dorsiflexion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Common fibular (peroneal) nerve neuropathy</strong> is typically due to compression or trauma, most commonly at the fibular head or neck due to the nerve&#39;s superficial location.&nbsp; Injury is associated with sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot and impaired dorsiflexion and eversion.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can clarify neurolocalization.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Parkinsonism, most commonly due to basal ganglia abnormalities, leads to a <a href=\"54870\">hypokinetic gait</a> characterized by difficulty initiating steps, a narrow base, shuffling or festinating strides, asymmetrically reduced arm movement, and en bloc turning.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cerebellar ataxia can result from lesions of the vermis (truncal ataxia) or cerebellar hemispheres (limb ataxia).&nbsp; Features include a <a href=\"61186\">wide-based gait</a> with staggering and swaying from side to side, impaired tandem gait, and titubation (truncal tremor).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pyramidal or corticospinal tract lesions can cause <a href=\"61187\">spastic ataxia</a>.&nbsp; Gait appears stiff or rigid with circumduction (spastic leg is abducted and advanced while in extension and internal rotation) and plantar flexion of the affected limb.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Damage to the corticocortical white matter tracts of the frontal lobe, as seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus, can lead to gait (Bruns) ataxia.&nbsp; Strength, coordination, and sensory functions are intact; initiation of forward movement of the feet is difficult, so they appear stuck to the ground (magnetic gait).</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with loss of proprioception due to sensory neuronopathy (eg, from vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency) may have a high-stepping gait and slap or stomp their feet to increase sensory feedback.&nbsp; However, sensory ataxia is usually wide-based, deficits are typically bilateral, and positive <a href=\"4553\">Romberg sign</a> is expected because sensory ataxia is typically caused by damage to the dorsal columns.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Foot drop is caused by injury to nerves supplying the foot dorsiflexors (eg, L5 radiculopathy, common fibular [peroneal] neuropathy).&nbsp; Patients must flex the hip and knee to avoid dragging the foot, which results in a unilateral high-stepping, or steppage, gait.</p>",
