NADPH oxidase generates <strong>superoxide free radicals</strong> in the phagolysosome of neutrophils as part of the <a href=\"5908\">oxidative burst</a>.</p><p>Impaired NADPH oxidase activity allows invading bacteria and fungi to escape destruction following phagocytosis.&nbsp; Therefore, patients are at high risk for recurrent <strong>bacterial</strong> (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Nocardia, Burkholderia cepacia</em>, <em>Serratia marcescens</em>) and <strong>fungal</strong> (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em>) <strong>infections</strong>.&nbsp; Risk is greatest with pathogens containing <strong>catalase</strong>, an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide (a free radical).&nbsp; CGD is diagnosed by measuring oxidative burst with <strong>dihydrorhodamine 123</strong> testing, a <strong>flow cytometry</strong> assay that uses a rhodamine derivative that fluoresces green when oxidation occurs (normal) and is colorless when respiratory burst is absent (CGD).</p><p><em><strong>Nocardia</strong></em>, a partially acid-fast, filamentous, gram-positive rod, is one of the most common pathogens in patients with CGD and should be suspected in the setting of <strong>cavitary pneumonia</strong>.&nbsp; Patients are also at risk for recurrent abscesses (eg, liver, skin), adenitis, and granulomas (eg, gastrointestinal, genitourinary).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; X-linked agammaglobulinemia is marked by abnormal B-cell development, leading to reduced mature B cells and very low levels of serum immunoglobulin.&nbsp; It typically presents with recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) due to lack of opsonizing IgG.&nbsp; Because humoral immunity does not play a major role in control of <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Nocardia</em> infections typically are not seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Natural killer (NK) cells primarily destroy viral-infected and tumor cells.&nbsp; Primary immunodeficiency in NK cells usually manifests as severe herpes virus infections in infancy.&nbsp; NK cells are not a major component of defense against bacteria; therefore, <em>Nocardia</em> infection and lymphadenitis typically are not seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"47058\">Complement</a> helps control infections by generating membrane attack complexes and the opsonizing protein C3ba.&nbsp; Early complement disorders (eg, C1 complex) are marked by recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infection and childhood systemic lupus erythematosus.&nbsp; Late complement disorders (eg, C5-9) are marked by recurrent encapsulated bacterial infection, particularly with <em>Neisseria</em>.&nbsp; Complement does not play a major role in the control of <em>Nocardia</em> infections.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are susceptible to cavitary pneumonia caused by <em>Nocardia</em> due to impaired respiratory burst and defective intracellular killing by neutrophils.&nbsp; Diagnosis of CGD is established by measuring the phagocytic oxidative response via flow cytometry.</p>",

These findings are concerning for a primary&nbsp;<strong>immunodeficiency</strong>.&nbsp; In the setting of low IgA and IgG and markedly elevated IgM, the most likely cause is <strong>hyper-IgM syndrome</strong>.</p><p>Hyper-IgM syndrome is an <strong>X-linked</strong> recessive defect in the <strong>CD40 ligand</strong>, which is normally present on T cells and binds to CD40 on B cells.&nbsp; This interaction induces <a href=\"46292\">immunoglobulin class switching</a>, in which immature B cells that normally express only IgM isotypes can produce other isotypes (ie, IgG, IgA, IgE).&nbsp; <strong>Deficiency</strong> of CD40 ligand in hyper-IgM syndrome prevents class switching, leading to <strong>elevated IgM</strong> levels and a <strong>deficiency of all other immunoglobulin types</strong>.&nbsp; Although they are dysfunctional, B- and T-cell concentrations are normal.&nbsp; Lymphocytosis can occur during active infection, and neutropenia, as seen in this patient, is common.</p><p>Hyper-IgM syndrome generally presents in infancy with <strong>recurrent sinopulmonary infections</strong> (eg, acute otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis) caused by encapsulated bacteria (due to lack of opsonizing IgG).&nbsp; Patients also have frequent viral infections and an increased risk of opportunistic infections (eg, <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia), reflecting impaired T-cell interaction with antigen-presenting cells.&nbsp; Growth impairment can result from a high energy expenditure and poor intake during illness.&nbsp; Treatment includes antibiotic prophylaxis and intravenous immunoglobulin.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia presents in infancy with recurrent sinopulmonary infections but is characterized by low levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA, as well as low or absent B lymphocytes.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Common variable immunodeficiency is characterized by a normal B-lymphocyte count and low levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA.&nbsp; It most commonly presents in adolescents or young adults.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; HIV classically presents with severe opportunistic infections, diarrhea, and failure to thrive.&nbsp; However, leukopenia is expected, and the CD4/CD8 ratio would be low.&nbsp; Because of chronic inflammation, IgG and IgA may be elevated, but IgM is typically low.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; IgA deficiency is often asymptomatic but can cause recurrent respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or urogenital infections.&nbsp; Serum IgA is low, whereas IgM and IgG are normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is characterized by bleeding due to microthrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, and eczema.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s normal platelet count excludes this diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hyper-IgM syndrome is a primary humoral immunodeficiency due to CD40 ligand deficiency.&nbsp; Patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and their immunoglobulin profile shows high IgM levels and low IgG and IgA.</p>",

Specifically, his Gram stain showing organism-filled neutrophils is suggestive of <strong>chronic granulomatous disease</strong> (CGD).&nbsp; CGD is caused by a mutation that prevents phagocytic respiratory burst, or the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>).&nbsp; This results in <strong>impaired intracellular killing</strong> by phagocytes.&nbsp; CGD is most commonly inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, as seen in this male patient with a maternal uncle who had similar symptoms.</p><p>Patients with CGD experience <strong>recurrent infections</strong> starting in early childhood and are classically susceptible to catalase-positive organisms (eg, <strong><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></strong>, <strong><em>Aspergillus</em></strong>).&nbsp; Catalase is an enzyme that can destroy H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> produced by the pathogen itself, thereby limiting any pathogen-produced ROS for neutrophil use.&nbsp; Infections of the <strong>lungs</strong> (eg, pneumonia, empyema), <strong>skin/soft tissue</strong>, and <strong>lymph nodes</strong> (eg, suppurative adenitis) are most common.&nbsp; Leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts typically are normal or elevated, and phagocytic cells filled with bacteria (due to ineffective intracellular killing) are a frequent finding on Gram stain.</p><p>The diagnosis of CGD is made by testing <strong>neutrophil oxidative burst</strong> on <strong>dihydrorhodamine</strong> (DHR) 123 or nitroblue tetrazolium test.&nbsp; DHR flow cytometry is preferred and uses a rhodamine derivative that fluoresces green when oxidized (normal) but remains colorless when oxidative burst is impaired (CGD).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; Low B cell concentrations and immunoglobulin levels are characteristic of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).&nbsp; Patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, not <em>Aspergillus</em>.&nbsp; <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>S aureus</em> infections can occur in hyper-IgE syndrome; however, unlike this case, abscesses are &#x22;cold&#x22; (ie, nontender, nonfluctuant) because the pathophysiology of hyper-IgE syndrome involves impaired neutrophil chemotaxis.&nbsp; Moreover, bacteria-filled phagocytes are inconsistent with both XLA and hyper-IgE syndrome.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; CH50 assays are used to determine total complement concentration.&nbsp; Complement deficiencies present with recurrent infections from encapsulated bacteria, particularly <em>Neisseria</em>.&nbsp; <em>S aureus</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> infections are inconsistent with complement deficiency.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; T cell concentrations are markedly low in severe combined immunodeficiency and 22q11.2 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome).&nbsp; T cell defects cause severe, recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infection from early infancy.&nbsp; Low absolute leukocyte count with lymphopenia would be expected, and organism-filled neutrophils do not occur.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by impaired intracellular killing by phagocytes.&nbsp; Pneumonia, cutaneous abscesses, and suppurative adenitis are common.&nbsp; Diagnosis is made by abnormal neutrophil respiratory burst testing (eg, dihydrorhodamine 123, nitroblue tetrazolium).</p>",

These findings are consistent with <strong>X-linked agammaglobulinemia</strong> (XLA), or Bruton agammaglobulinemia, a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in tyrosine kinase in B cells.&nbsp; This defect results in failure of bone marrow pre-B cells to mature into circulating CD19<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> B cells, leading to low immunoglobulin production.</p><p>When protection from maternally derived transplacental IgG antibodies wanes at age 3-6 months, patients with XLA develop recurrent <strong>sinopulmonary</strong> (eg, acute otitis media, pneumonia) and <strong>gastrointestinal</strong> (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter, Giardia</em>) infections.&nbsp; Physical examination in children age &gt;2 with XLA is remarkable for underdeveloped or absent lymphoid tissue (eg, tonsils, adenoids).&nbsp; Notably, these tissues are not prominent even in healthy children age &lt;2.</p><p>Laboratory findings consistent with XLA include <strong>low serum IgG, IgM, and IgA</strong>, impaired antibody response to vaccines, and markedly <strong>reduced CD19<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> B cells</strong>; T-cell count is normal.&nbsp; Detection of <em>BTK</em> gene mutation confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Treatment is immunoglobulin replacement therapy (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin) with or without prophylactic antibiotics.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; CD40 ligand deficiency (X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome) presents in infancy with recurrent sinopulmonary infections and is characterized by low IgG and elevated IgM due to defective class-switch recombination.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s low IgM makes this diagnosis unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Common variable immunodeficiency causes recurrent infections due to low IgG, IgM, and IgA but typically does not present until after adolescence.&nbsp; In addition, differentiation of B cells into plasma cells is impaired, but CD19<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> B-cell concentration is normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is caused by impaired T-cell development and subsequent B-cell dysfunction.&nbsp; Affected patients develop life-threatening bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections in infancy.&nbsp; B- and T-cell concentrations are markedly decreased in SCID.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy is characterized by decreased IgG, variable IgM, and normal IgA and B-cell concentrations.&nbsp; Affected patients develop mild, recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections.&nbsp; Immunoglobulin levels generally normalize by age 9-15 months.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, microthrombocytopenia, and eczema.&nbsp; B and T cells are classically decreased but may be normal in infancy, and immunoglobulin profile shows low to normal IgG and IgM with elevated IgA and IgE.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>X-linked (or Bruton) agammaglobulinemia presents with recurrent sinopulmonary or gastrointestinal infections in late infancy.&nbsp;

Chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies contain <strong>foreign proteins</strong> derived from other animals (eg, mice).&nbsp; Exposure to foreign proteins triggers an adaptive immune response marked by the generation of high affinity antibodies.&nbsp; Binding of the high affinity antibody to the foreign portion of the medication generates <strong>immune complexes</strong> (ICs), which are subsequently cleared by mononuclear cells in the reticuloendothelial system.</p><p>Although the formation and removal of ICs often proceeds without symptoms, large quantities of ICs can saturate the phagocytic system and lead to IC aggregation.&nbsp; The aggregated ICs can then <strong>deposit into tissue</strong> (eg, skin, joints, glomeruli), activate the classical complement system, and cause a <strong>type III hypersensitivity reaction</strong> called <strong>serum sickness</strong>.</p><p>Common manifestations include <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>urticarial rash</strong>, <strong>arthralgia</strong>, and mild proteinuria.&nbsp; These symptoms <strong>resolve spontaneously</strong> as the ICs are cleared, but patients may develop recurrent symptoms 5-14 days after each dose of the medication.&nbsp; In addition to monoclonal antibodies, antitoxins, antivenoms, or antigenic vaccines can cause serum sickness reactions.&nbsp; Some antibiotics (eg, penicillin) can cause a serum sickness&ndash;like reaction that is not due to high IC titers.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Bacterial endocarditis often causes fever, arthralgia, and rash.&nbsp; However, the rash typically presents as macular lesions on the palms (Janeway lesions) or violaceous nodules on the toes/fingers (Osler nodes); urticarial rash is uncommon.&nbsp; In addition, negative blood cultures, no heart murmur, and normal complete blood count make endocarditis unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; IgE can form against chimeric antibodies and trigger urticarial rash upon reexposure due to mast cell and basophil degranulation (type I hypersensitivity reaction).&nbsp; However, fever, arthralgia, and proteinuria would be somewhat atypical.&nbsp; In addition, type I reactions typically begin within minutes of drug infusion.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary tuberculosis usually causes subacute fever, malaise, and pulmonary symptoms; proteinuria and urticarial rash would be atypical.&nbsp; In addition, because immunomodulators (eg, infliximab) dramatically increase risk of <em>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</em> reactivation, most patients receive screening for latent tuberculosis prior to medication initiation, also making symptomatic tuberculosis&nbsp;unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Type IV hypersensitivity reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) are mediated by cytotoxic T cells.&nbsp; Stevens-Johnson syndrome causes high fever, arthralgia, and rash, but the rash is typically sunburn-like and diffuse; in addition, mucocutaneous lesions are usually present.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Serum sickness is an immune complex&ndash;mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs after exposure to foreign proteins in antivenoms, antitoxins, monoclonal antibodies, or antigenic vaccinations.&nbsp; Manifestations typically arise 5-14 days after exposure and include fever, urticarial rash, arthralgia, and mild proteinuria; symptoms usually resolve over days without intervention as the immune complexes are cleared.</p>",

Although SSLR and serum sickness (SS) share similar clinical presentations, the underlying triggers and mechanisms differ.&nbsp; SS is triggered by foreign proteins in antitoxins, antivenoms, or monoclonal antibodies; it is marked by the generation of high titer immune complexes, immune complex deposition in tissue, and significant complement activation.&nbsp; In contrast, SSLR is typically triggered by beta-lactam (eg, <strong>amoxicillin</strong>) or sulfa antibiotics; it is thought to be due to genetic deficiencies in eliminating the metabolic by-products of these medications, which leads to hapten-mediated cytotoxic T-cell injury or direct cytotoxicity.</p><p>SSLR is most common in <strong>children</strong> and usually presents <strong>5-14 days</strong> after medication initiation.&nbsp; Most patients have a <strong>mildly pruritic urticarial rash</strong> that persists &gt;24 hours.&nbsp; Significant <strong>multiarticular joint pain</strong> is usually present.&nbsp; Examination usually reveals pain with joint movement, but signs of arthritis (eg, joint warmth, swelling, erythema) are usually absent.&nbsp; Low grade fever and generalized lymphadenopathy often occur.</p><p>Symptoms of SS and SSLR <strong>resolve completely</strong> over several days as the medication is eliminated by the mononuclear phagocyte system (SS) or by metabolic pathways (SSLR).&nbsp; However, the inciting medication should be discontinued in those still taking it.&nbsp; Although future exposure may not cause recurrent symptoms, the drug should be avoided when possible.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Nephritogenic strains of group A <em>Streptococcus</em> can cause glomerulonephritis due to immune complex formation.&nbsp; Although arthralgia is common, patients will have abnormal urinalysis (eg, hematuria, casts).&nbsp; In addition, urticaria would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Late Lyme disease can cause chronic, progressive arthritis.&nbsp; Although Lyme disease is associated with rash, arthralgia, and fever shortly after transmission, the rash is a spreading, target-shaped, annular lesion (erythema migrans).&nbsp; Urticarial rash and recent beta-lactam therapy make SSLR more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Epstein-Barr virus can increase risk for malignancy (eg, lymphoma), and treatment with amoxicillin during acute infection often causes rash.&nbsp; However, the rash is usually generalized, diffuse, and maculopapular; urticarial rash and lack of pharyngitis would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Spontaneous SSLR does not occur; SSLR and SS require recent exposure to medication, vaccine, or foreign protein antigens.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Serum sickness&ndash;like reaction is usually triggered by antibiotic therapy (eg, penicillin, sulfa drugs).&nbsp; It typically occurs in children 5-14 days after medication initiation and presents with low-grade fever, urticarial rash, and arthralgia.&nbsp; Manifestations resolve completely as the medication is metabolized over days.</p>",

These findings are concerning for a primary humoral immunodeficiency such as <strong>common variable immunodeficiency</strong> (CVID).&nbsp; CVID is caused by <strong>impaired differentiation of B cells into plasma cells</strong>, which results in decreased production of various immunoglobulins.</p><p>CVID commonly presents in early adulthood (age 20-40) or <strong>adolescence</strong> (around puberty) with <strong>recurrent sinopulmonary infections</strong>, typically caused by encapsulated bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) because antibody opsonization is required for clearance of these organisms.&nbsp; Recurrent gastrointestinal infections (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Giardia</em>) can also occur due to low IgA levels.&nbsp; In addition, patients may have associated atopic (eg, asthma, eczema) or autoimmune (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) conditions.</p><p>Immunoglobulin profile in patients with CVID reveals <strong>low IgG</strong> as well as <strong>low IgA and/or IgM</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Antibody responses to vaccines</strong> (ie, vaccine titers) are also <strong>low</strong>.&nbsp; Complete blood count would show a normal amount of white blood cells.&nbsp; Treatment is immunoglobulin replacement therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is characterized by absent B-cell production due to a defect in pre&ndash;B-cell maturation in the bone marrow.&nbsp; All immunoglobulin levels and vaccine titers are markedly low or absent.&nbsp; However, presentation is typically in infant boys after maternally derived IgG wanes (age 4-6 months), and there is often a family history of males with recurrent hospitalizations. &nbsp;Although this adolescent patient had ear infections as a toddler, these are common in any toddler and resolved quickly with antibiotics; furthermore, the patient&nbsp;had no other infections during most of his childhood, which would be unusual for XLA and&nbsp;makes CVID more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Classic presentation of terminal complement deficiency is recurrent <em>Neisseria</em> infections.&nbsp; Immunoglobulin levels and vaccine titers would be normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Because helper T cells play a role in B-cell activation, patients with T-cell deficiency (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency) may have decreased antibody production in addition to impaired cell-mediated immunity.&nbsp; Unlike in this patient, severe bacterial, viral, and fungal infections would begin in early infancy.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is characterized by impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, leading to frequent skin and respiratory infections.&nbsp; Immunoglobulin levels and vaccine titers would not be affected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Common variable immunodeficiency is characterized by decreased immunoglobulin production due to impaired differentiation of B cells into plasma cells.&nbsp; Patients typically develop recurrent sinopulmonary infections after puberty and have low IgG plus low IgA and/or IgM, as well as decreased antibody response to vaccines.</p>",

Patients are predisposed primarily to recurrent <strong>lung infections</strong> (eg, pneumonia, empyema, hilar lymphadenopathy) and <strong>abscesses</strong> (eg, skin, liver, lymph node); perirectal infection is common.</p><p>The pathogenesis of CGD involves NADPH oxidase.&nbsp; This enzyme is normally responsible for the neutrophil <strong>respiratory burst</strong>, a process in which reactive oxygen species (eg, superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide) are formed and activate lysosomal proteases involved in pathogen destruction.&nbsp; Patients with CGD have mutations in NADPH oxidase and therefore <strong>decreased</strong> production of <strong>superoxide anions</strong>.&nbsp; Although neutrophils may use hydrogen peroxide produced by pathogens, organisms that produce catalase can degrade their own reactive oxygen species.&nbsp; Therefore, infections in CGD are typically due to <strong>catalase-positive</strong> bacteria and fungi (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em><strong>B cepacia</strong></em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>).</p><p>Patients with CGD also develop characteristic <strong>granulomas</strong>, as seen in this boy, that can involve many organ systems (eg, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, lungs).&nbsp; The pathogenesis likely involves migration of phagocytes to infection sites but inability to degrade inflammatory signals and invading organisms; this leads to a chronic and focal aggregation of inflammatory cells, or granulomas.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>&nbsp; Decreased immunoglobulin production, as seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, generally presents with recurrent sinopulmonary infections.&nbsp; Typical pathogens include encapsulated bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) due to lack of opsonizing IgG.&nbsp; Similarly, complement dysfunction (eg, C3 deficiency) also causes defective opsonization and infection due to encapsulated bacteria.&nbsp; Perirectal abscess, granulomas, and <em>B cepacia</em> infection are not expected with either condition.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Impaired airway clearance is a feature of cystic fibrosis (CF), which can predispose to <em>B cepacia</em> pneumonia, but granuloma formation does not occur.&nbsp; In addition, infections in CF are limited to the sinopulmonary tract, so perirectal abscesses would not be seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis is seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency.&nbsp; Patients are susceptible to recurrent skin and mucosal infections; however, pneumonia with granuloma formation does not occur.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chronic granulomatous disease is due to a defect in NADPH oxidase, resulting in decreased formation of superoxide anions and inability of phagocytes to kill certain bacterial and fungal pathogens.&nbsp; The presentation includes recurrent abscesses and pulmonary infections caused by catalase-positive organisms (eg, <em>Burkholderia</em> [<em>Pseudomonas</em>] <em>cepacia</em>) and granuloma formation.</p>",
