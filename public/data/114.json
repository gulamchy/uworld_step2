Spinal stenosis is due to <a href=\"4338\">narrowing of the spinal canal</a> with resulting compression of lumbar nerve <strong>roots</strong>.&nbsp; Common contributing factors include degenerative arthritis of the spine (spondylosis/spinal <strong>osteoarthritis</strong>), including degenerative disk disease, and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, leading to mechanical narrowing and compression.</p><p>The pain of spinal stenosis is often associated with activity, as <strong>lumbar extension</strong> during walking worsens the narrowing of the canal.&nbsp; This is termed <strong>neurogenic claudication</strong> and can resemble the lower extremity vascular claudication seen in obstructive atherosclerotic arterial disease.</p><p>Although this patient&#39;s pain likely reflects spinal stenosis/neurogenic claudication, both spinal stenosis/neurogenic claudication and vascular claudication can be seen in older patients with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>In contrast to the pain of vascular claudication, that of neurogenic claudication is postural rather than exertional.&nbsp; It can persist at rest if the spine remains extended but is lessened by spine flexion (eg, walking uphill, leaning on an assistive device), often referred to as the &#x22;<a href=\"5578\">shopping cart sign</a>.&#x22;&nbsp; In this patient, the pattern of the pain (eg, improves when leaning on cane) and the normal ankle-brachial index are more consistent with neurologic than vascular claudication <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Diabetic peripheral neuropathy causes burning or tingling pain that begins in the feet and progresses proximally in a &#x22;stocking-glove&#x22; distribution.&nbsp; Postural back pain is not characteristic.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Spinal cord compression (eg, due to malignancy) presents acutely or subacutely with back pain, paralysis, hyperreflexia, fecal incontinence, or urinary incontinence/retention.&nbsp; Given this patient&#39;s 6-month history of positional back pain and his normal physical examination, his symptoms are likely due to nerve root compression rather than spinal cord compression.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The spondyloarthropathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis) are more common in younger patients.&nbsp; They are characterized by back pain and stiffness that worsen with rest and improve with activity.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Vertebral compression fractures typically present with acute back pain following a minor injury (eg, ground-level fall).&nbsp; The pain usually diminishes with time.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Vertebral metastasis is characterized by constant, dull pain that is worse at night.&nbsp; Patients often have a history of malignancy or systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Lumbar spinal stenosis is most commonly caused by degenerative changes in the spine and presents with low back and leg pain.&nbsp; The leg pain of neurogenic claudication is position-dependent (exacerbated by lumbar extension) and persists even while standing still.&nbsp; Vascular claudication is exertion-dependent and resolves with standing still.</p>",

FM occurs most commonly in young to middle-aged women and presents with <strong>widespread pain</strong>, fatigue, and cognitive/mood disturbances.&nbsp; Patients have a fairly normal physical examination except for <strong>trigger point</strong> tenderness in areas such as the mid trapezius, lateral epicondyle, costochondral junction, and greater trochanter.&nbsp; Patients perceive that their pain and fatigue worsen acutely after exercise, although a regular, incremental, low-impact <strong>exercise regimen</strong> (eg, fast walking, swimming, water aerobics) can improve pain and provide long-term benefit.</p><p>The diagnosis of FM is primarily based on history and examination findings.&nbsp; Revised 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria suggest using the <a href=\"176\">widespread pain index and symptom severity score</a> for diagnosis, as these reflect the cognitive and somatic symptoms of the disorder better than criteria based on trigger points.&nbsp; Laboratory tests, including inflammatory (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein [CRP]) and serologic (eg, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody) markers, are typically normal.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Although polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) occurs at age &gt;50 and can cause acute or subacute pain, it more commonly causes stiffness of the shoulders (~75%-90%) and pelvic girdle.&nbsp; Patients may have focal tenderness due to bursitis or synovitis; however, true muscle tenderness is unusual.&nbsp; Giant cell (temporal) arteritis frequently occurs in association with PMR and presents with headache, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances.&nbsp; Inflammatory markers are almost always elevated in these disorders, with sensitivity of CRP approaching 100%.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Polyarteritis nodosa presents with systemic symptoms, skin findings (eg, livedo reticularis, purpura), kidney disease, abdominal pain, and muscle aches or weakness.&nbsp; CRP is usually elevated.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Polymyositis is characterized by symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes (eg, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, aldolase).&nbsp; Pain is generally absent or mild.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with pain and swelling in the wrists and small joints of the hands (eg, metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal), morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms.&nbsp; CRP levels correlate with disease activity.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis) are most common in men age 15-35 and rarely present at age &gt;45.&nbsp; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP are frequently elevated.&nbsp; Back pain in these disorders is typically worse with rest and better with activity, in contrast to FM, in which pain is acutely worse with exercise and only gradually diminishes with a regular exercise regimen.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Fibromyalgia presents commonly in young to middle-aged women with widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive/mood disturbances.&nbsp; Diagnosis is made clinically using the widespread pain index and symptom severity score, which emphasize cognitive problems, fatigue, and severity of somatic symptoms.</p>",
