This combination strongly suggests a malignancy affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract or associated solid organs, such as the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.&nbsp; Among the choices listed, <strong>pancreatic adenocarcinoma</strong> is the most likely diagnosis.</p><p>Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States; peak incidence is in the late seventh (for men) and eighth (for women)&nbsp;decade.&nbsp; <strong>Smoking</strong> is an important risk factor.&nbsp; Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate as it is frequently diagnosed at relatively late stages (early-stage disease usually causes only mild, nonspecific symptoms).&nbsp; Symptoms of pancreatic cancer vary and depend primarily on the location of the tumor.</p><p>Most (60%-70%) pancreatic cancers originate in the head of the pancreas.&nbsp; These cancers are more likely to present with <strong>jaundice</strong> (common bile duct obstruction) and <strong>steatorrhea</strong> (inability to secrete fat-digesting enzymes or blockage in the main pancreatic duct).&nbsp; However, jaundice may appear at a later stage if the tumor arises from the tail or body of the pancreas.&nbsp; Most patients describe epigastric <strong>abdominal pain</strong> that is usually insidious, gnawing, and <strong>worse at night</strong>.&nbsp; However, some patients may not have pain and simply present with <strong>painless jaundice</strong>.&nbsp; Systemic symptoms such as <strong>weight loss and fatigue</strong> are common.&nbsp; Another classic association is <strong>migratory thrombophlebitis</strong> (Trousseau syndrome).</p><p>Diagnosis is established with either ultrasound (less expensive) in patients with jaundice (head tumors) or CT scan (highly sensitive) in patients without jaundice (body and tail tumors).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; A chronic subdural hematoma from trauma would be more likely in an elderly person and typically presents with headache, personality changes, seizures, confusion, or hemiparesis.&nbsp; Abdominal pain and tenderness with anorexia and weight loss are not expected.&nbsp; Although neurogenic gastric mucosal injury (Cushing ulcer) can be associated with traumatic brain injury, this condition is characterized by acute onset, usually with prominent gastric bleeding and obvious neurologic impairment.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Duodenal ulcers can also cause burning epigastric pain.&nbsp; However, the pain is typically periodic and relieved by food, as it is generally a result of acid secretion in the absence of a food buffer.&nbsp; Anorexia and weight loss are less common.&nbsp; Antisecretory therapy with proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists generally provides some relief.&nbsp; This patient describes constant pain accompanied by anorexia, weight loss, and systemic symptoms, red flags that should raise suspicion for a malignancy.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; A major depressive episode could be responsible for fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss, but abdominal pain and tenderness would not be typical.&nbsp; Even if a primary mood disorder is suspected, localized pain with weight loss usually warrants evaluation for occult malignancy.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consists of persistent reexperiencing of a previous traumatic event with recurrent attacks of anxiety, hyperarousal, nightmares, and/or flashbacks.&nbsp; This patient may have experienced a stressful event during his criminal investigation, but he does not describe recurrent distressing memories or nightmares related to the event.&nbsp; In addition, PTSD disturbs social and occupational functioning but does not typically cause anorexia, weight loss, or signs of organic disease such as abdominal pain and tenderness.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pancreatic cancer classically presents insidiously with a combination of constant and gnawing epigastric pain that is frequently worse at night, anorexia with weight loss, and jaundice due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction.&nbsp; A peptic duodenal ulcer typically causes periodic epigastric pain relieved by meals.</p>",
