KS is an endothelial malignancy triggered by the reactivation of <strong>human herpesvirus 8</strong> (HHV8).&nbsp; Because men who have sex with men are at greatest risk for HHV8 infection, most cases of HIV-associated KS arise in this patient population; however, those who acquire HIV via another mechanism (eg, injection drug use, blood transfusion) are also at risk.</p><p>HIV-associated KS is typically marked by the development of papular cutaneous lesions that may become confluent.&nbsp; The lower extremities, face, oral mucosa, and genitalia are most often affected.&nbsp; The lesions are <strong>violaceous</strong>, pink, red, or brown due to an abundance of erythrocytes within the tumor vasculature and tissue.&nbsp; Pruritus, pain, and skin necrosis are rare.&nbsp; Obstruction of draining lymphatic channels can cause distal lymphedema (eg, lower extremity swelling).&nbsp; Visceral lesions in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract may be life-threatening.&nbsp; Patients frequently have other symptoms (eg, weight loss, diarrhea) of severe HIV infection at presentation.</p><p>The diagnosis is usually established based on the presence of characteristic lesions, but patients with atypical lesions or systemic symptoms may require biopsy to exclude other diseases (eg, bacillary angiomatosis due to <em>Bartonella</em>).&nbsp; Because the tumor arises due to unchecked HHV8 replication in the setting of profound immunosuppression (eg, low CD4, high viral load), <strong>first-line treatment</strong> is <strong>antiretroviral therapy</strong> (ART).&nbsp; Local therapy (eg, intralesional chemotherapy) is sometimes provided for cosmetic reasons.&nbsp; Systemic chemotherapy is typically reserved for those with visceral lesions, widespread/rapidly progressive disease, or recalcitrant lesions following ART initiation; this patient with lesions limited to the groin and mild lower extremity edema does not require systemic chemotherapy at this time <strong>(Choice F)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; The presence of several violaceous papular lesions in a patient with risk factors for HIV should raise suspicion for KS.&nbsp; Parasites and fungi are less likely to cause this type of cutaneous lesion.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Syphilis is treated with penicillin and often causes rash.&nbsp; However, the rash does not appear as violaceous papules; primary syphilis is marked by a single chancre, and secondary syphilis is distinguished by a widespread maculopapular rash.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Podophyllotoxin and imiquimod are topical medications used to treat <a href=\"2309\">condylomata acuminata</a>, genital warts caused by certain serotypes of human papillomavirus.&nbsp; These typically appear as skin-colored verrucous and filiform papules in the anal/perianal area, penile shaft, or vulvovaginal and cervical areas.&nbsp; Lymphedema is uncommon.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an AIDS-defining malignancy caused by human herpesvirus 8.&nbsp; Cutaneous KS develops most commonly on the lower extremities, face, oral mucosa, and genitalia.&nbsp; The lesions usually appear as multiple violaceous papules.&nbsp; First-line treatment for limited disease is antiretroviral initiation; local and systemic therapy are not generally required.</p>",

Parvovirus is among the most common causes of acute viral arthritis (others include hepatitis B and C, HIV, and rubella).&nbsp; Parvovirus infection most commonly affects adults who have frequent contact with children (eg, <strong>school teachers, daycare workers</strong>).&nbsp; Children with parvovirus infection often develop a &#x22;slapped cheek&#x22; rash as part of erythema infectiosum.&nbsp; Nearly 75% of adults with parvovirus infection develop a nonspecific rash, but &lt;20% have the characteristic erythema infectiosum rash.</p><p>Adults most commonly develop a <strong>polyarticular, symmetric</strong> arthritis (60% of cases) involving peripheral joints, including the hands (metacarpophalangeal [MCP], proximal interphalangeal [PIP], and wrist), knees, and ankles.&nbsp; Arthritis due to parvovirus B19 typically does not cause joint destruction or chronic arthritis.&nbsp; Other possible nonspecific findings include fever, fatigue, and diarrhea.&nbsp; Parvovirus B19 infection is diagnosed by detecting anti-B19 IgM antibodies in the serum, which develop within 10-15 days of infection and usually remain positive for 1-6 months.&nbsp; The symptoms typically resolve spontaneously in 2-3 weeks without the need for specific treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and G)</strong>&nbsp; Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and rheumatoid factor are usually associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&nbsp; RA presents with joint stiffness &#8805;1 hour in the morning, <strong>joint swelling</strong> on examination, and <strong>symptoms for &gt;6 weeks</strong>.&nbsp; Although parvovirus can affect similar joints (eg, MCP, PIP, wrist), this patient&#39;s acute symptom onset (10 days) and absence of both joint swelling and prolonged joint stiffness in the morning make RA less likely.&nbsp; In addition, RA would be unusual at age 27.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; Antinuclear antibody testing is highly sensitive for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies are highly specific for the diagnosis.&nbsp; There is significant overlap in the appearance of parvovirus-related arthritis and the arthritis of SLE, but SLE most often causes chronic rather than acute arthritis.&nbsp; Other findings of SLE include malar or discoid rash, hematologic abnormalities (eg, anemia), renal disease, fever, malaise, and weight loss.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s short duration of joint pain and absence of other findings make SLE unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Anti-streptolysin titers are positive in patients with acute rheumatic fever and indicate recent streptococcal infection.&nbsp; Typical findings include migratory polyarthritis, pancarditis, Sydenham&#39;s chorea, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules.&nbsp; However, the arthritis of rheumatic fever is usually migratory and initially affects lower-extremity joints.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Mixed cryoglobulinemia is usually associated with chronic hepatitis C and can cause arthralgias.&nbsp; The arthralgias of mixed cryoglobulinemia usually occur in association with a chronic vasculitic syndrome characterized by palpable purpura, lymphadenopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.</p><p><strong>Educational objective</strong>:<br>Parvovirus B19 can cause an acute symmetric arthritis of the hands (metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and wrist), knees, and ankle joints.&nbsp; The diagnosis can be confirmed with anti-parvovirus B19 IgM.&nbsp; The syndrome is usually self-limited and does not require specific treatment.</p>",
