Grip would not be affected with Tourette syndrome because tone and strength are normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Wilson disease is characterized by impaired copper excretion due to defective copper transport.&nbsp; Neuropsychiatric manifestations can include chorea and labile mood, but onset is insidious, not acute, and abnormal liver function studies would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a degenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons that can cause weakness and a pseudobulbar affect (eg, inappropriate laughing).&nbsp;

TS, a neurological disorder with childhood onset, is characterized by a combination of <strong>vocal</strong> (eg, throat clearing) and <strong>motor</strong> (eg, blinking, shoulder shrugging) tics.&nbsp; Tic severity typically peaks at age 10-12, and tics are exacerbated by anxiety, fatigue, and psychosocial <strong>stress</strong>.&nbsp; When tics are severe and debilitating (eg, declining academic performance, psychosocial dysfunction), as in this patient, treatment options include <strong>behavioral suppressive therapy</strong> (eg, habit reversal training, substituting a voluntary movement incompatible with the tic) and pharmacological interventions.</p><p><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> of TS consists of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Antidopaminergic drugs:</strong>&nbsp; Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 <strong>(VMAT2) inhibitors</strong> (eg, tetrabenazine) function as dopamine depleters, whereas antipsychotic medications (eg, risperidone) block dopamine postsynaptic receptors and carry risks of parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and metabolic effects.&nbsp; VMAT2 inhibitors are therefore increasingly preferred as <strong>initial treatment</strong> over antipsychotics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists</strong> (eg, guanfacine, clonidine) can be considered in patients with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or behavioral symptoms.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Antisense oligonucleotide therapy is an investigational treatment for Huntington disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by choreiform movements and neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dementia.&nbsp; However, it is an inherited condition (eg, family history of progressive motor and cognitive decline) that is most common in midlife, with diagnosis prior to the age of 20 being rare.&nbsp; In addition, this patient&#39;s partial response to behavioral suppressive therapy in middle school makes TS more likely than HD.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Copper chelation therapy is used in the treatment of Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that presents with hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms.&nbsp; Neurological manifestations commonly include dysarthria, dystonia, ataxia, parkinsonism, and drooling, rather than the waxing and waning tics seen in this patient.&nbsp; In addition, this patient has no hepatic impairment, making TS the more likely diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The GABA agonist medication clonazepam (a benzodiazepine) is a first-line treatment option for myoclonus; this patient&#39;s motor and vocal tics are consistent with TS rather than myoclonus.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Serotonergic drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) would not effectively target this patient&#39;s tics.&nbsp; These medications may help treat patients with TS who have comorbid anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pharmacotherapy of Tourette syndrome consists of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, antipsychotic medications, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists.&nbsp; VMAT2 inhibitors are increasingly preferred as initial treatment over antipsychotics due to a more favorable adverse effect profile.</p>",
