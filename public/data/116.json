Given his elevated aminotransferases (raising suspicion for chronic hepatitis), the SVV is probably due to <strong>mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome</strong> (MCS).</p><p>MCS is due to cryoglobulins (abnormal immunoglobulins that precipitate at &lt;37 C) formed by IgM binding to the Fc region of IgG (ie, <strong>rheumatoid factor activity</strong>).&nbsp; These <strong>immune complexes</strong> activate complement (causing <strong>hypocomplementemia</strong>) and deposit in small vessels of multiple organs (causing SVV).&nbsp; Nonblanchable, palpable purpura (reflecting vasculitis-induced inflammation) is particularly classic.&nbsp; MCS likely results from B-cell hyperactivation, most commonly due to <strong>chronic hepatitis C</strong> infection.&nbsp; Therefore, all patients with suspected MCS require <strong>hepatitis serologies</strong> (even if aminotransferases are normal, which can occur despite infection).</p><p>Serum cryoglobulins must be confirmed; if negative, other SVV etiologies (eg, IgA vasculitis) should be considered.&nbsp; Other viral infections (eg, hepatitis B, HIV) and autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) are less common causes of MCS and are unlikely in this patient (negative HIV and antinuclear antibody titers).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; B-cell lineage malignancies (eg, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia), diagnosed using bone marrow biopsy, can produce type I cryoglobulins.&nbsp; These monoclonal immunoglobulins form cold-induced precipitates that cause multiorgan involvement.&nbsp; However, typical manifestations include vascular occlusive symptoms, such as <a href=\"49483\">livedo reticularis</a> (blanchable vs nonblanchable purpura in MCS) and digital ischemia, and hyperviscosity-induced neurologic symptoms (eg, blurred vision, vertigo).&nbsp; Rheumatoid factor is negative, complement is normal, and frank vasculitis is rare.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), due to decreased von Willebrand factor (vWF)&ndash;cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) activity, commonly causes fatigue and rash.&nbsp; However, TTP reflects microvascular thrombosis (from vWF-platelet binding), causing hemolysis and platelet consumption.&nbsp; Therefore, anemia/thrombocytopenia are severe, and the associated <a href=\"43493\">petechial rash</a> is nonpalpable (vs palpable in MCS).&nbsp; Unlike MCS, TTP-induced kidney injury is typically mild and lacks significant hematuria; neurologic involvement (eg, confusion) is classic and hypocomplementemia is rare.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Antiphospholipid syndrome results from autoantibodies (eg, anticardiolipin) that cause thrombosis/thromboembolism.&nbsp; Patients typically have large-vessel venous or arterial thrombosis (eg, deep vein thrombosis, stroke), not seen in this patient.&nbsp; Microvascular thrombosis mimicking SVV (eg, rash, acute kidney injury) can occur but is rare.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is a small-vessel vasculitis that causes palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, arthralgias, and peripheral neuropathy.&nbsp; Laboratory abnormalities include cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, and hypocomplementemia.&nbsp; Chronic hepatitis C infection is the most common cause, and serologies should be checked in all patients.</p>",

The mass may be asymptomatic and an incidental finding on imaging, or it may present as a <strong>hard, painless nodule</strong> near a joint, as in this patient.&nbsp; Pain may develop if there is local compression of neurovascular structures, but systemic features (eg, fever, weight loss) are absent.&nbsp; An x-ray revealing <a href=\"79060\">metaphyseal exostosis</a>&nbsp;(bony spur) with a <strong>cortex that is continuous</strong> with the surrounding bone is diagnostic.</p><p>The natural course of an osteochondroma is to <strong>grow</strong> with the surrounding bone <strong>until physeal closure</strong> (ie, skeletal maturity).&nbsp; Most lesions then remain static through adulthood and are typically managed with <strong>observation</strong> alone.&nbsp; The risk of malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma in adulthood is very low (1%) for a solitary lesion, but patients should be counseled on worrisome signs (eg, growth after physeal closure) <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Aggressive destruction of the local cortex can occur in benign bone tumors such as <a href=\"79014\">chondroblastoma</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"78893\">giant cell tumor</a>, which are characterized by radiolucent lesions in the epiphysis.&nbsp; The bony spur in this patient&#39;s x-ray is consistent with an osteochondroma, which characteristically retains cortical continuity with adjacent bone.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pathological fracture due to medullary expansion is caused by intramedullary tumors that lead to cortical thinning and bone weakening, like that seen in <a href=\"79061\">unicameral bone cysts</a>&nbsp;and certain malignancies (eg, osteosarcoma).&nbsp; Although pathologic fractures can occur in patients with osteochondroma, this complication is rare and is due to a break in the stalk of a pedunculated lesion, not medullary expansion.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"631\">Osteoid osteoma</a>&nbsp;is a benign bone tumor that spontaneously involutes over several years.&nbsp; It presents with nocturnal pain, and x-ray reveals a small, round radiolucency with sclerotic margins, features not seen in this patient.&nbsp; Osteochondroma does not spontaneously involute.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that presents as a firm mass, classically near a joint.&nbsp; X-ray reveals metaphyseal exostosis (bony spur) with a cortex that is continuous with adjacent bone. The natural course is growth until physeal closure (skeletal maturity), and management is typically observation alone.</p>",
