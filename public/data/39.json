Crying usually occurs around the same time of the day (eg, evening), and parents often have difficulty consoling the infant only during this time.&nbsp; Symptoms peak at age 6 weeks and typically resolve by age 3-4 months.&nbsp; The cause of colic is unknown but may be related to gut immaturity or suboptimal feeding techniques (eg, excessive swallowing of air).&nbsp; A complete history and physical should be performed because colic is a <strong>diagnosis of exclusion</strong>.</p><p>Initial <strong>management</strong> includes providing parents with <strong>reassurance</strong> and support.&nbsp; <strong>Soothing techniques</strong> should be reviewed and include using a pacifier; holding, rocking, or swaddling the baby; and minimizing environmental stimuli (eg, dark room).&nbsp; Use of swings, carriers, and strollers can also be calming and allows parents to rest from active soothing.&nbsp; In addition, adjusting feeding techniques (eg, upright feeding position in bottle-fed babies) may help reduce air swallowing and relieve colic.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Intussusception (telescoping of one bowel portion into another), most common at age 6-36 months, presents with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain.&nbsp; Vomiting and bloody stools may be present.&nbsp; Intussusception is diagnosed with abdominal ultrasound, but this patient&#39;s age and crying pattern make it unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Gastroesophageal reflux disease can present with irritability, spitting up, and back-arching after feeds.&nbsp; Severe reflux leading to feeding refusal and poor weight gain may require treatment with an H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> receptor blocker.&nbsp; This patient is growing well with crying unrelated to feeding.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute otitis media can present with irritability plus a bulging tympanic membrane (TM) and/or a middle ear effusion with TM inflammation (eg, erythema).&nbsp; TM erythema alone is not diagnostic of this condition and does not warrant oral antibiotics.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Lactose intolerance necessitating lactose-free formula is extremely rare in infancy but typically presents with frothy or watery stools.&nbsp;
