Although children most commonly have type 1 DM (T1DM), the incidence of T2DM in <strong>older adolescents</strong> is increasing with the rise in childhood obesity (BMI &#8805;95th percentile).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s age, BMI, <strong>family history</strong> of DM, and <a href=\"25315\">acanthosis nigricans</a> make <strong>T2DM</strong> the most likely diagnosis.</p><p>Pathogenesis involves environmental and genetic factors.&nbsp; Excess adiposity contributes to <strong>insulin resistance</strong>; in adolescents, this resistance is potentiated by rising growth hormone during puberty.&nbsp; Pancreatic beta cells initially produce more insulin to compensate but become dysfunctional over time and produce less insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia.&nbsp; Insulin resistance alone does not always correlate with the development of diabetes, and genetic factors likely also play a role in <strong>impaired insulin secretion</strong> in susceptible individuals.</p><p>Findings associated with insulin resistance include central (visceral) <strong>obesity</strong>, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; <strong>acanthosis nigricans</strong> is common (possibly reflecting insulin effects of keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and manifests as velvety, hyperpigmented patches in intertriginous areas (eg, neck, axillae).&nbsp; Patients are at increased risk for candidiasis, as seen in this adolescent, because hyperglycemia allows for increased adhesion of <em>Candida</em> to the epithelium.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Pathogenesis of T1DM involves pancreatic autoantibodies causing islet cell destruction and low/absent insulin production.&nbsp; Insulin resistance (eg, acanthosis nigricans) is uncommon, and patients are less likely to be obese than with T2DM.&nbsp; In addition, presentation is usually acute (ketoacidosis, ketonuria) in early childhood or early puberty.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Anti-insulin receptor antibodies may cause severe insulin resistance by blocking the action of insulin.&nbsp; This condition is exceedingly rare and often coexists with autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), making it far less likely than T2DM in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Glucokinase mutations cause monogenic diabetes (previously maturity-onset diabetes of the young), in which mildly defective glucose sensing results in relatively low insulin secretion for any given glucose level.&nbsp; Unlike in T2DM, hyperglycemia is mild (&lt;140 mg/dL), and patients typically lack signs of insulin resistance.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Glucagonoma is a rare tumor that produces excessive glucagon, causing hyperglycemia.&nbsp; Beta cells function normally, and signs of insulin resistance would not be expected.&nbsp; Patients also usually have weight loss, rash, and diarrhea, none of which are seen in this adolescent.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents is increasing in association with a rise in childhood obesity; a positive family history and acanthosis nigricans are common.&nbsp; Pathogenesis involves insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.</p>",

This patient is afebrile with normal complete blood count and brain imaging, making an infectious or structural cause unlikely.&nbsp; A transiently disrupted metabolic process (eg, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia) is also unlikely given the normal electrolytes and glucose.&nbsp; However, her&nbsp;<strong>microcephaly</strong>&nbsp;(eg, head circumference at 2nd percentile) and <strong>lack of newborn screening</strong>&nbsp;raise concern for an <strong>inborn error of metabolism</strong> such as <strong>phenylketonuria</strong> (PKU).</p><p>PKU is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which <a href=\"63207\">phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency</a> results in an inability to metabolize phenylalanine into tyrosine.&nbsp; Although small amounts of phenylalanine are necessary for growth and development (essential amino acid), <strong>excess phenylalanine</strong> is thought to disrupt normal neuronal development and increase oxidative stress in the brain, causing <strong>irreversible neurologic injury</strong> when untreated.&nbsp; Neurologic findings include microcephaly, seizures, and poor feeding.&nbsp; Other features include <strong>eczema</strong>&nbsp;(as seen in this patient), hypopigmentation, and a musty body odor.</p><p>Patients with PKU are asymptomatic at birth and usually identified via hyperphenylalaninemia (eg, on tandem mass spectrometry) on universal newborn screening, which tests for &gt;20 disorders (eg, metabolic disorders, HIV, cystic fibrosis).&nbsp; Prompt initiation of a phenylalanine-restricted diet (ie, avoiding protein-rich foods) prevents disease manifestations.&nbsp; In undiagnosed or untreated patients, like this girl, serum phenylalanine and its neurotoxic by-products <strong>accumulate</strong>&nbsp;(eg, over weeks to months) when dietary phenylalanine (eg, breast milk, formula) is introduced.&nbsp; Diagnosis in symptomatic patients is typically established via hyperphenylalaninemia on <strong>serum amino acid analysis</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Flow cytometry for lymphocyte subsets can be used to diagnose severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which can cause neurologic findings due to CNS infection.&nbsp; However, this patient is afebrile, is easily arousable, and has a flat fontanelle, making infection unlikely.&nbsp; Moreover, patients with SCID typically have lymphopenia and poor growth in height/weight, findings not seen in this girl.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Karyotype can be used to diagnose aneuploidies associated with microcephaly and seizures (eg, trisomy 13).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s lack of dysmorphic features makes a genetic syndrome unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Rapid plasma reagin testing screens for congenital syphilis.&nbsp; Symptomatic patients typically have hepatomegaly and a maculopapular rash; neither is seen in this girl.&nbsp; Although CNS involvement can rarely occur, rapidly increasing head circumference with a bulging fontanelle would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with congenital hypothyroidism (normally diagnosed via newborn screening) may develop lethargy and poor feeding if untreated, but seizures would not be seen.&nbsp; Other expected findings include a wide fontanelle and macroglossia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Phenylketonuria is characterized by impaired phenylalanine metabolism, leading to the buildup of phenylalanine and its neurotoxic metabolites and irreversible neurologic injury (eg, seizures, microcephaly).&nbsp; Hyperphenylalaninemia via serum amino acid analysis is diagnostic.</p>",

Administration of insulin drives potassium into cells, resulting in hypokalemia.&nbsp; Potassium should be added to intravenous fluids once serum potassium is &lt;5.3 mEq/L.&nbsp; When glucose reaches &lt;200 mg/dL, patients also should be given dextrose-containing fluids to avoid hypoglycemia, but insulin should be continued to ensure resolution of ketosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; After intravascular volume is restored, if serum sodium is normal or elevated, the intravenous fluid is changed to 0.45% saline.&nbsp; Normal saline is used initially regardless of sodium levels.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and E)</strong>&nbsp; A solution of 5% dextrose provides only limited volume resuscitation because as dextrose is metabolized the solution becomes hypotonic, promoting water shift out of the intravascular space.&nbsp; NPH and glargine have a long duration of action and do not allow rapid dose titration; they are usually restarted when DKA has resolved.&nbsp; Finally, intravenous insulin is preferred to subcutaneous insulin (except in very mild DKA) due to the latter&#39;s unpredictable absorption (erratic skin perfusion).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with DKA can have pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia; this patient&#39;s corrected sodium (observed sodium + ~2 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL glucose is over 100 mg/dL) is normal (128 + ~2 x 4.5 = 128 + ~9 = ~137 mEq/L).&nbsp; Hypertonic saline is reserved for moderate to severe (true) hyponatremia.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; In most patients with DKA, administration of bicarbonate is not beneficial and may lead to cerebral edema, reduced tissue oxygenation, hypokalemia, and alkalosis.&nbsp; Bicarbonate is reserved for severe acidosis (pH &#8804;6.9), plasma bicarbonate &lt;5 mEq/L, or severe hyperkalemia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Essential measures in diabetic ketoacidosis include:</p><ol><li>Hydration to restore intravascular volume, with 0.9% (normal) saline recommended in the first 1-2 hours</li><li>Correction of hyperglycemia and ketosis with intravenous regular insulin</li><li>Serial assessment of electrolytes, especially potassium</li><li>Treatment of the underlying precipitating factors</li></ol>",

Deficiency results in an <strong>inability to metabolize galactose to glucose</strong>, leading to galactose accumulation in tissues.</p><p>Symptoms of poor feeding and <strong>vomiting</strong> develop in the first few days of life after the introduction of galactose, which is found in breast milk and cow&#39;s milk&ndash;based formula.&nbsp; Galactose accumulation also leads to <strong>jaundice</strong> and <strong>hepatomegaly</strong> (hepatic dysfunction), and cataract formation may occur.&nbsp; Because excessive galactose can impair leukocyte function and superoxide release, patients are also at increased risk for <em><strong>Escherichia coli</strong></em>&nbsp;<strong>sepsis</strong>, which may be the initial presentation of galactosemia in some neonates.</p><p>Supportive laboratory findings include hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis (from renal tubular damage due to galactose accumulation), <strong>elevated transaminases</strong>, and <strong>conjugated</strong> and/or <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>.&nbsp; Although elevated direct bilirubin reflects hepatic involvement, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is likely due to the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in red blood cells (RBCs), promoting erythrocyte death (ie, <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong>).</p><p>Absent RBC GALT activity confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Treatment is dietary elimination of galactose by using a soy-based formula.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by inadequate NADPH production and can cause neonatal jaundice (due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and hemolytic anemia.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s <em>E coli</em> sepsis and elevated transaminases make this diagnosis less likely than galactosemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an immunodeficiency disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <em>WAS</em> gene.&nbsp; Patients are predisposed to recurrent infections but have eczema and thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s platelet count is normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Spherocytosis, which causes jaundice and hemolytic anemia, is due to a mutation in the proteins (eg, spectrin, ankyrin) linking the RBC membrane to its cytoskeleton.&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation would show normal transaminases and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, findings not seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Although sickle cell disease can cause hemolytic anemia and jaundice (due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia), its presentation typically occurs after age 6 months, when gamma chain (found in fetal hemoglobin) production decreases and <a href=\"19082\">beta-globin chain production</a> increases.&nbsp; Hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases would not be expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Galactosemia is characterized by the inability to metabolize galactose (found in breast and cow&#39;s milk) to glucose, resulting in galactose accumulation and hypoglycemia.&nbsp; Patients may have vomiting, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and <em>Escherichia coli</em> sepsis.&nbsp; Hyperbilirubinemia may be conjugated (ie, liver dysfunction) and/or unconjugated (ie, hemolytic anemia).</p>",
