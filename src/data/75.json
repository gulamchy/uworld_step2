Patients may have fever but are usually not toxic appearing.</p><p>Acute, unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is typically due to gram-positive bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>) and occurs in children age &lt;5.&nbsp; However, <strong>anaerobic bacteria</strong>, which account for most normal oropharyngeal flora, are less common causative pathogens in children age &lt;5 but are often implicated in older children with <strong>poor dental hygiene</strong> (eg, dental caries) or periodontal disease.&nbsp; Poor oral hygiene allows anaerobic bacteria to <strong>spread</strong> from the oropharynx into surrounding tissue and <strong>locally</strong> draining lymph nodes.</p><p>The diagnosis of acute, unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is usually clinical.&nbsp; Abscess, which is suggested by <strong>fluctuance</strong> on examination, may require incision and drainage, as in this patient.&nbsp; Empiric antibiotic therapy targets both gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp;

<em>Bartonella henselae</em>, an aerobic, gram-negative bacterium, is transmitted via a cat scratch or bite, causing catscratch disease.&nbsp; Symptoms include subacute or chronic lymphadenitis and a papular skin lesion at the site of injury.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Sporotrichosis is a chronic infection acquired after exposure to soil or moss (eg, during rose gardening) with the fungus <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em>.&nbsp; Symptoms classically include nodular papules or ulcerations at the site of exposure and along the draining lymphatic chain.&nbsp;

TB is most common among children with risk factors for exposure, including traveling from an endemic area, residing in a <strong>homeless shelter</strong> (as in this case), or having close contact with an infected household member.</p><p>Similar to patients with secondary (reactivation) TB, children with <a href=\"6797\">primary</a> pulmonary TB infection typically have <strong>chronic cough</strong> or fever of unknown origin (not always present); although chronic cough is generally defined as &gt;8 weeks in adults and &gt;4 weeks in children, even shorter durations (eg, &gt;2 weeks in adults, &gt;3 weeks in children) can raise suspicion for TB in the appropriate epidemiologic and clinical setting.&nbsp; <strong>Hilar lymphadenopathy</strong> (often reflecting Ghon complex) on chest x-ray is characteristic, and a <strong>consolidation</strong> or pleural effusion may also be present; unlike with secondary (reactivation) TB, cavitary disease involving the upper lungs is not commonly seen. &nbsp;Lung auscultation can reveal rhonchi, decreased breath sounds, or wheezing in the affected area&nbsp;(possibly due to endobronchial involvement or to compression from surrounding lymphadenopathy). &nbsp;Other nonspecific findings can include fatigue and weight loss or failure to thrive. &nbsp;Unlike in adults, reactivation disease (eg, bilateral upper lung cavitation) is rare in children.</p><p>Screening for TB begins with measuring T-cell response to tuberculin, either via tuberculin skin testing (ie, purified protein derivative) or by an interferon-gamma release assay.&nbsp; Confirmation requires culture of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> from <strong>sputum samples</strong> (older children/adults).&nbsp; Younger children who cannot generate sufficient cough can be tested with early-morning <strong>gastric lavage</strong>, which recovers <em>M tuberculosis</em> from swallowed tracheal secretions.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Asthma can present with chronic cough and diffuse wheezing due to bronchospasm.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s wheezing is unilateral, and asthma does not cause a focal infiltrate or hilar adenopathy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Foreign body aspiration in young children can cause focal consolidation and wheezing, as well as chronic cough.&nbsp; However, foreign body aspiration does not cause hilar adenopathy.&nbsp; In addition, aspiration is most common in the right lung due to the directionality of the large airways.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> causes atypical (eg, bilateral) pneumonia in school-age children.&nbsp; <em>Mycoplasma</em> is not associated with unilateral lung findings or hilar adenopathy.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common cause of focal pneumonia in children.&nbsp; However, it is not classically associated with hilar adenopathy, and this patient was treated for pneumococcus with an adequate course of antibacterial therapy, without resolution of symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral bronchiolitis in young children.&nbsp; RSV bronchiolitis presents with diffuse, not focal, wheezing and crackles and rarely lasts longer than 10 days.&nbsp; RSV also does not cause hilar adenopathy.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Primary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) should be suspected in children with chronic cough and characteristic chest x-ray findings (eg, hilar lymphadenopathy, consolidation, pleural effusion), particularly if they have risk factors for TB exposure (eg, homeless shelter).</p>",
