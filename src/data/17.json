This patient&#39;s automatic negative interpretation of experiences and avoidance behavior make her a good candidate for CBT.</p><p>CBT is used as monotherapy or in combination with medication to treat a variety of mental illnesses (eg, <strong>depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders</strong>).&nbsp; Treatment is generally time limited (approximately 5-20 sessions) and structured, and involves homework.&nbsp; Therapists work with patients to identify and change <strong>cognitive distortions</strong>, such as overgeneralization (eg, believes nothing ever works out) and catastrophizing (eg, assumes the worst outcome).&nbsp; Behavioral techniques such as graded exposure target the <strong>avoidance behaviors</strong> that stem from these distortions.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Biofeedback involves using signals from the body (ie, heart rate, muscle tension, skin temperature, blood pressure) as indicators of emotional distress.&nbsp; Patients are taught to identify and control their responses to various stimuli.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Dialectical behavioral therapy was developed for borderline personality disorder and targets the emotional dysregulation and self-destructive and suicidal behaviors associated with this disorder.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Interpersonal psychotherapy is an evidence-based therapy primarily used for depression that focuses on the interplay between depressive symptoms and interpersonal stressors.&nbsp; This patient does not have a specific interpersonal conflict.&nbsp; Her general cognitive distortions and avoidance behaviors are the main cause of her distress and are best targeted with CBT.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Motivational interviewing is commonly used to treat substance abuse and involves the therapist assuming a nonjudgmental stance, acknowledging ambivalence, focusing on the patient&#39;s motivation for change, and tolerating resistance to change.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on the role of unconscious conflict and gaining insight into how past experience shapes present situations.&nbsp; It does not specifically target thought patterns and avoidance behaviors.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Supportive psychotherapy is used to reinforce a patient&#39;s ability to cope with stressors and is commonly used for low-functioning patients or those in crisis who are at risk of decompensation.&nbsp; For a more stable patient, such as this woman, CBT provides a more in-depth and targeted approach.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cognitive-behavioral therapy focuses on reducing automatic negative thoughts and avoidance behaviors that cause distress.&nbsp;
