Such cases require airborne precautions (ie, negative-pressure rooms, respiratory masks with a minimum 95% filtering capacity [eg, <a href=\"1817\">N95 masks</a>]) to prevent inhalation <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>This patient&#39;s presentation is due to <strong><em>Neisseria meningitidis</em></strong>, gram-negative diplococci that can cause a potentially fatal meningitis characterized by rapid progression and hemodynamic compromise.&nbsp; <em>N meningitidis</em> reproduces primarily in the nasopharynx, and infectious particles are readily aerosolized through coughing and respiratory procedures (eg, intubation).&nbsp; The organism is transmitted through relatively <strong>large respiratory particles</strong> that do not retain infectivity well on surfaces outside the body.&nbsp; Therefore, droplet precautions are indicated for possible cases of <em>N meningitidis</em>.&nbsp; These measures are typically implemented until the patient has been treated with 24 hours of antibiotic therapy (eg, ceftriaxone).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Infections that spread through direct physical contact of infected materials or on fomites (eg, skin and enteric infections) merit the use of contact precautions with providers wearing both gown and gloves in patient rooms.&nbsp; Many respiratory viruses transmit via both direct contact and respiratory droplets, requiring both contact and droplet precautions.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Neutropenic precautions provide protection for patients at risk for infection due to profound immunosuppression.&nbsp; The goal is to prevent exposure of the patient rather than the health care worker; therefore, no specific protective gear is required unless contact with bodily fluids is anticipated.&nbsp; Common neutropenic precautions include strict hand hygiene, private rooms with high-efficiency air filtration, no live plants or animals, and avoidance of intrusive probes (eg, rectal thermometers, enemas).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Standard precautions (previously universal precautions) should be followed in the care of all patients.&nbsp; They include hand hygiene before and after contact, use of safety gear when there is possible contact with bodily fluids, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and safe injection practices.&nbsp; Standard precautions are included within all other precautions.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br><em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> reproduces primarily in the nasopharynx, and infectious particles are readily aerosolized through coughing and respiratory procedures.&nbsp;
