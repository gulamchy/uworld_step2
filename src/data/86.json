It primarily proliferates in soil contaminated by <strong>bird or bat droppings</strong>.&nbsp; Infections in immunocompetent individuals are almost always asymptomatic (&lt;5% develop pulmonary or disseminated disease).&nbsp; However, those with defects in cell-mediated immunity&nbsp;are far more likely to develop <strong>progressive disseminated histoplasmosis</strong> (PDH), with <strong>HIV</strong>&nbsp;(particularly with a&nbsp;<strong>CD4 count &lt;150/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font></strong>) being an important risk factor.</p><p>PDH is marked by the spread of <em>H capsulatum</em> from the lungs through the lymphatic channels to the systemic circulation with subsequent unchecked multiorgan infection.&nbsp; Patients develop a <strong>febrile, wasting</strong> disorder with prominent <strong>pulmonary</strong> (dyspnea, cough), <strong>mucocutaneous</strong> (papules, nodules), and <strong>reticuloendothelial</strong> (lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly) manifestations.&nbsp; Laboratory examination often shows <strong>pancytopenia</strong> (due to bone marrow infiltration) and elevated aminotransferase/lactate dehydrogenase levels.&nbsp; Many patients have diffuse interstitial or <strong>reticulonodular infiltrates</strong> on chest x-ray (the lungs are usually the portal of entry).&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed most rapidly with <strong>serum or urine <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen immunoassay</strong> (sensitivity &gt;95%).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Pneumocystis&nbsp;jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.&nbsp; It is marked by subacute dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever.&nbsp; Patients with suspected PCP who have negative induced sputum samples often receive bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.&nbsp; PCP does not commonly cause lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or pancytopenia.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Most patients with suspected histoplasmosis receive fungal blood cultures; however, culture results usually take 4-6 weeks for identification.&nbsp; Therefore, urine or serum <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen is the test of choice for diagnosis (highly sensitive and rapid).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although histoplasmosis can be diagnosed by lymph node biopsy, this invasive procedure is rarely required.&nbsp; Disseminated tuberculosis (diagnosed by lymph node biopsy) and HIV-associated lymphoma (eg, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, fever)&nbsp;could explain many of this patient&#39;s findings; however, cutaneous lesions are uncommon, and pleuropulmonary lymphomatous involvement often causes effusions (vs reticulonodular opacities).&nbsp; The combination of pulmonary, mucocutaneous, and reticuloendothelial findings in the correct epidemiologic setting (eg, recent move to Missouri) makes PDH more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Syphilis may cause subacute febrile symptoms and mucocutaneous lesions.&nbsp; However, pulmonary involvement and pancytopenia are uncommon.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br><em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> rarely causes illness in immunocompetent patients; however, in patients with AIDS, progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is the norm (&gt;90%).&nbsp; Urine or serum <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen assay is a rapid, sensitive test for diagnosing PDH.</p>",

<em>Blastomyces dermatiditis</em> affects primarily areas in the Midwest and Upper Midwest regions of the United States, extending into the <a href=\"859\">southern Mississippi Valley</a>.</p><p>Primary infection occurs through inhalation, and blastomycosis most often causes a mild to moderate <strong>pulmonary infection</strong>.&nbsp; Extrapulmonary disease due to hematogenous spread most commonly affects the <strong>skin</strong>. &nbsp;<strong>Bone</strong>, <strong>prostate</strong>, and the central nervous system are also frequently involved.&nbsp; Skin lesions of blastomycosis have a characteristic presentation of heaped-up verrucous or nodular lesions with a violaceous hue that may evolve into microabscesses.&nbsp; Some patients may develop skin involvement despite having no symptoms from the primary pulmonary infection.&nbsp; <strong>Disseminated disease</strong> can occur in both <strong>immunocompetent</strong> and immunocompromised patients, but it is usually more severe in immunocompromised individuals.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and F) &nbsp;<em>Actinomyces</em> and <em>Nocardia</em></strong> are <strong>Gram-positive rods</strong> (and <em>Nocardia</em> is also weakly acid-fast).&nbsp; <em>Nocardia</em> often presents as a subacute pneumonia that mimics tuberculosis infection.&nbsp; The majority of patients are immunocompromised.&nbsp; <em>Actinomyces</em> causes abscesses primarily at the head and neck with characteristic granular yellow pus (&#x22;sulfur granules&#x22;).&nbsp; It can also cause indolent pulmonary disease.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)&nbsp; Aspergillosis</strong> is caused by <em>Aspergillus</em>&nbsp;<strong>molds</strong> (various species) and most commonly causes invasive pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients.&nbsp; Cutaneous manifestations are unusual, and culture/fungal stains show mold rather than the yeast seen in blastomycosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Coccidioidomycosis causes predominantly pulmonary infections (&#x22;valley fever&#x22;).&nbsp; It has been reported in a wide geographic distribution but is found primarily in the <a href=\"860\">desert Southwest and Central Valley of California</a>.&nbsp; Skin manifestations, although uncommon, include erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s raised and ulcerated lesions are more typical of blastomycosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis caused by <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, a soil-based fungus with a wide distribution found primarily in the <a href=\"858\">Mississippi and Ohio River valleys</a>.&nbsp; It usually causes an asymptomatic or mild pulmonary infection.&nbsp; Immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease may develop papular, crusting skin lesions, but disseminated infection is rare in immunocompetent patients.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Sporotrichosis is caused by the fungus <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em> and arises from direct inoculation of the skin.&nbsp; It is typically acquired from rose bushes or similar organic materials.&nbsp; The pustular and ulcerated lesions of sporotrichosis are localized to the site of the wound or associated lymphatic channels. &nbsp;As a result, the patient usually knows the origin of the infection.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Blastomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to the central United States.&nbsp; It usually causes a mild pulmonary illness, but disseminated infection may occur even in immunocompetent individuals.&nbsp; Cutaneous blastomycosis manifests as well-circumscribed verrucous nodules and plaques that progress to microabscesses.</p>",

The presence of <strong>subacute</strong> pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea, dry cough, fever), tachypnea, hypoxemia, and <strong>bilateral interstitial infiltrates</strong> on <a href=\"45584\">chest x-ray</a> indicates likely <em><strong>Pneumocystis</strong></em>&nbsp;<strong>pneumonia</strong> (PCP), a common harbinger of AIDS in patients previously unaware of HIV infection.&nbsp; Most cases arise when CD4 counts are <strong>&lt;200/mm</strong><font size=\"2\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></font>.</p><p>Manifestations typically build over weeks and include progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and fever.&nbsp; Chest x-ray frequently reveals bilateral pulmonary reticulonodular infiltrates.&nbsp; Diagnosis requires the identification of organisms in respiratory secretions using microscopy with specialized stains.&nbsp; Induced sputum often provides adequate samples, but bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is required when induced sputum cannot be obtained or is unrevealing (as in this case).</p><p><strong>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</strong> (TMP-SMX) is the first-line treatment for PCP.&nbsp; Patients with mild or moderate disease are treated with oral TMP-SMX, whereas those with more severe disease (eg, large alveolar-arterial gradient, low PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, tachypnea) often require intravenous therapy.&nbsp; Because TMP-SMX may transiently worsen pulmonary function (likely due to the inflammatory effects of lysed organisms), <strong>concomitant corticosteroids</strong> (eg, prednisone) are administered to patients with severely impaired oxygenation.&nbsp; This includes those with pulse oximetry &lt;92%, PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> &#8804;70 mm Hg, or alveolar-arterial gradient &#8805;35 mm Hg on room air.&nbsp; Antiretroviral therapy should also be initiated within 2 weeks (once hypoxia improves) to prevent AIDS progression.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Ceftriaxone with azithromycin is used to treat community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and vancomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam is used to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).&nbsp; Both CAP and HAP tend to cause acute illness (within hours or days), productive cough, and lobar infiltrates on chest x-ray.&nbsp; Although CAP due to an atypical organism (eg, <em>Mycoplasma</em>) can sometimes cause subacute, nonproductive cough and interstitial infiltrates, patients usually have mild illness; significant dyspnea/hypoxia and high fever would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are used to treat tuberculosis, which tends to present with fever, hemoptysis, and weight loss.&nbsp; Chest x-ray usually reveals apical, cavitary infiltrates.&nbsp; This patient has bilateral interstitial infiltrates, making PCP more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Liposomal amphotericin B is used to treat severe fungal infections (eg, histoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis).&nbsp; Pulmonary histoplasmosis usually causes focal or perihilar infiltrates (not diffuse interstitial infiltrates) on chest x-ray.&nbsp; Amphotericin B is not commonly used in the treatment of PCP.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br><em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia is common in patients with advanced AIDS (CD4 counts &lt;200/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).&nbsp;
