Ehrlichiosis is a <strong>tick-borne</strong> infection caused by <em>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</em> and <em>E ewingii</em>.&nbsp; These bacteria are carried by ticks, including the lone star tick (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>), found in the <strong>southeastern and south central United States</strong>.&nbsp; The principal reservoir is the white tail deer.</p><p>Ehrlichiosis is characterized by an <strong>acute febrile illness with malaise and altered mental status</strong>.&nbsp; Ehrlichiosis is <strong>not often associated with a rash</strong> (&lt;30% in adults) and is described as &#x22;Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) without the spots.&#x22;&nbsp; Neurologic symptoms may include confusion, mental status changes, clonus, and neck stiffness.&nbsp; Laboratory studies often show <strong>leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia</strong>, along with <strong>elevated aminotransferases</strong> and lactate dehydrogenase.</p><p>The diagnosis is often clinical, although definitive diagnosis can be made through visualization of intracytoplasmic morulae in white blood cells or through polymerase chain reaction testing.&nbsp; <strong>Doxycycline</strong> is the appropriate treatment and is <strong>often initiated empirically</strong> when the diagnosis is suspected while confirmatory testing is pending.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and F)</strong>&nbsp; Elevated liver enzymes and hematologic abnormalities, including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, can be attributed to ehrlichiosis.&nbsp; As a result, hepatitis serologies and bone marrow biopsy would not be warranted.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and G)</strong>&nbsp; Ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of neurologic and cardiac manifestations of <a href=\"1004\"><strong>Lyme disease</strong></a>.&nbsp; Several factors make Lyme disease less likely in this patient.&nbsp; <em>I</em><em>xodes scapularis</em>, the tick that carries <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, is not commonly found in the southern United States.&nbsp; The majority (80%) of patients with early localized (primary) Lyme disease (within days of the tick bite) have the classic <a href=\"511\">erythema migrans</a> rash with or without constitutional symptoms.&nbsp; The <strong>absence of a rash</strong> and the <strong>presence of a high fever and hematologic and liver enzyme abnormalities</strong> make Lyme disease <strong>less likely</strong>.&nbsp; Finally, this patient does not exhibit any prominent neurologic (eg, encephalitis, cranial nerve palsy, radiculopathy) or cardiac (eg, heart block, pericarditis) manifestations of early disseminated (secondary) Lyme disease.&nbsp; These would more commonly occur several weeks to months after the initial tick bite.&nbsp; Given the low suspicion for the disease, Lyme serologies would not be indicated.&nbsp; Even if this patient has Lyme disease, doxycycline would be sufficient to treat it.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Chloramphenicol is a second-line treatment option for ehrlichiosis and RMSF.&nbsp; It is associated with blood dyscrasias and is not commonly used.&nbsp; In 90% of RMSF patients, a maculopapular rash (involving the soles and palms) occurs a few days after the onset of fever.&nbsp; The presence of leukopenia and absence of rash in this patient are more suggestive of ehrlichiosis than RMSF.&nbsp; Doxycycline is the first-line treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Erythromycin is not an effective treatment for ehrlichiosis.&nbsp; It has activity against <em>Legionella</em> and <em>Mycoplasma</em>.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Ehrlichiosis should be suspected in a patient from an endemic region with a history of tick bite, febrile illness with systemic symptoms, leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferases.&nbsp; Rash is uncommon, and the drug of choice is doxycycline.</p>",

The organism is prevalent worldwide, but the infection is more common in Mexico, China, Thailand, parts of central Europe, and Argentina.&nbsp; Infection usually occurs after eating undercooked or raw meat (usually pork) containing encysted <em>Trichinella</em> larvae.&nbsp; Within the first week of ingestion, gastric acid releases the encysted larvae.&nbsp; The larvae invade the small intestine and develop into worms (intestinal stage).&nbsp; Female worms can release new larvae (up to 4 weeks later) that migrate and encyst into striated muscle (muscle stage).</p><p>During the intestinal stage, patients can be asymptomatic or develop abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&nbsp; During the muscle stage, patients may develop local or systemic findings due to <strong>larval migration</strong> into various tissues; these include fever, subungual splinter hemorrhages, conjunctival and retinal hemorrhages, periorbital edema, and chemosis.&nbsp; Larvae entering the muscle can cause pain, tenderness, swelling, and weakness (eg, neck, arms, shoulders).&nbsp; Laboratory studies show eosinophilia (usually &gt;20%), the hallmark of the disease.&nbsp; Other findings include possible elevated creatine kinase and leukocytosis.&nbsp; Diagnosis is suspected clinically with the characteristic <strong>triad</strong> of <strong>periorbital edema</strong>, <strong>myositis</strong>, and <strong>eosinophilia</strong>.&nbsp; Severe disease can involve the heart, lungs, and central nervous system.</p><p>Mild infections are typically self-limited; severe infections require antiparasitic therapy (eg, mebendazole, albendazole) with corticosteroids.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Ascariasis can also present with intestinal symptoms and eosinophilia, but more often has a lung phase with nonproductive cough followed by an asymptomatic intestinal phase.&nbsp; Ascariasis can also present with the worms obstructing the small bowel or bile ducts.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s triad of periorbital edema, myositis, and eosinophilia is more consistent with trichinellosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dengue fever can present with fever, headache, and significant myalgia and arthralgias (with some patients developing hemorrhagic dengue fever with significant hemorrhage in the skin or nose).&nbsp; However, dengue fever does not usually cause marked eosinophilia, and it is classically associated with retro-orbital pain and rash.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute giardiasis can present with diarrhea (can be steatorrhea), flatulence, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and nausea.&nbsp; However, giardia usually does not cause the significant myalgias or eosinophilia seen in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Infective endocarditis can present with fever, cardiac murmur, and embolic phenomenon (eg, subungual splinter hemorrhages).&nbsp; Although this patient&#39;s drug use history can suggest endocarditis, this disorder usually does not cause significant eosinophilia or periorbital edema.&nbsp; Subungual splinter hemorrhages are classically associated with endocarditis but are also seen with trichinellosis (due to larval migration).</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Typhoid fever usually presents in a progressive manner with fever in the 1st week of illness, abdominal pain and salmon-colored rash in the 2nd week, and hepatosplenomegaly with abdominal complications (eg, intestinal bleeding, perforation) during the 3rd week.&nbsp; However, it does not cause significant eosinophilia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Trichinellosis typically presents with gastrointestinal complaints (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) followed by the characteristic triad of periorbital edema, myositis, and eosinophilia (hallmark of the disease).&nbsp;

It is transmitted by the <a href=\"5498\"><em>Ixodes scapularis</em></a> tick approximately 48-72 hours after attachment.&nbsp; Because <em>I scapularis</em> also transmits <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme disease) and <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em> (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), coinfection is fairly common.&nbsp; Peak prevalence is in July and August, when tick populations are at their highest.</p><p>Infection is often asymptomatic or mild, but patients with immunocompromise, age &gt;50, or <strong>asplenia</strong> are at higher risk for severe illness.&nbsp; Symptoms typically include the gradual onset of fatigue, malaise, weakness, chills, and fever.&nbsp; The organism multiplies in red blood cells, so patients may develop <strong>anemia</strong> with signs of <strong>intravascular hemolysis</strong> (eg, jaundice, dark urine, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, elevations of aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase).&nbsp; Thrombocytopenia is common, and mild hepatosplenomegaly may occur.&nbsp; The diagnosis is made by identifying organisms on peripheral <a href=\"2513\">blood smear</a> (&#x22;Maltese cross&#x22;).&nbsp; Treatment includes 7-10 days of atovaquone plus azithromycin or quinine plus clindamycin (for severe illness).&nbsp; Symptoms may take up to 3 months to fully resolve.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Rocky Mountain spotted fever is also transmitted by a tick bite.&nbsp; Symptoms often include fever, headache, myalgia, and a prominent rash (macular/petechial) that spreads centripetally (from the periphery toward the center) and includes the palms and soles.&nbsp; Hemolytic anemia is uncommon.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Lyme disease is also transmitted by <em>I scapularis</em>.&nbsp; Early disease is usually characterized by erythema migrans (a punched-out, spreading rash), fever, myalgia, headache, and/or lymphadenopathy.&nbsp; Anemia with intravascular hemolysis is not a feature of this illness.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>) illness that causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, myalgia, headache) and leukopenia/thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; It primarily occurs in the southeastern, south-central, and mid-Atlantic United States, rather than the northeastern United States (due to the geographic distribution of the transmitting tick).&nbsp; This patient with leukocytosis and signs of intravascular hemolysis is more likely to have babesiosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The diagnosis of dengue fever can be aided by using the tourniquet test, which involves inflating a blood pressure cuff on the arm to a point halfway between diastolic and systolic pressures and examining for petechiae 5 minutes later.&nbsp; Dengue fever is often asymptomatic, but some patients develop fever and severe myalgia/headache (breakbone fever).&nbsp; Leukopenia (not leukocytosis) and thrombocytopenia are common.&nbsp; Intravascular hemolysis would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Acute viral hepatitis is usually characterized by fever, vomiting, jaundice, abdominal pain, and dramatic elevations in aminotransferases (&gt;1,000 U/L).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Babesiosis is a tick-borne protozoal illness found primarily in the northeastern United States.&nbsp; Transmission occurs via the <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> tick, and coinfection with other microbes (eg, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>) can occur.&nbsp; Symptoms are often flu-like (eg, fever, chills, malaise), and laboratory studies usually show anemia with signs of intravascular hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;
