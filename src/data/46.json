            "explanationText": "<p>This clinical presentation - progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels - is consistent with <strong>congestive heart failure</strong> (CHF).&nbsp; BNP is a natriuretic hormone released from ventricular myocytes in response to high ventricular filling pressures and wall stress in patients with CHF.&nbsp; It is derived from the cleavage of the prohormone proBNP, which produces a biologically active BNP and an inert <strong>N-terminal proBNP</strong> (NT-proBNP).&nbsp; Elevated levels of circulating BNP or NT-proBNP correlate with the severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.&nbsp; Conversely, normal values have a very high negative predictive value for CHF as a cause of dyspnea and should prompt a search for noncardiac causes of dyspnea.</p><p>The <strong>third heart sound</strong> (S3) is a low-frequency diastolic sound produced by the passive ventricular filling during early diastole; it is best heard over the cardiac apex in the left lateral decubitus position.&nbsp; An abnormal S3 (louder and higher pitch, <strong>S3 gallop</strong>) is commonly heard in patients with CHF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (up to 99% specificity), and it correlates with elevated left atrial and/or ventricular filling pressures and serum BNP levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cyanosis can occur in patients with intrinsic lung disease or congenital heart defects with right to left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome), but it would be rare in CHF unless there is marked hypoperfusion (eg, hypotension, cold and clammy extremities).&nbsp; Cyanosis would not correlate with BNP levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Peripheral edema is one of the signs of CHF with volume overload; however, compared to S3, it is less specific to the diagnosis of CHF and correlates less closely with BNP levels.&nbsp; Peripheral edema can be seen with several noncardiac conditions, including inferior vena cava obstruction, cirrhosis, and lower extremity venous insufficiency.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Neck bruits can be present in patients with carotid artery stenosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; An abdominal or periumbilical bruit that lateralizes to one side can be heard in patients with renal artery stenosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Although wheezing can sometimes be heard in patients with a CHF exacerbation due to bronchial wall edema, in general it is a sign of bronchial constriction and is present in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.&nbsp; BNP levels are typically not elevated in patients with dyspnea due to pulmonary or noncardiac causes.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels and an audible third heart sound are signs of increased cardiac filling pressures and are noted in patients with congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.</p>",

It occurs due to global hypoperfusion of the brain and can have many causes.&nbsp; In many patients (eg, those with hypovolemia or vasovagal syncope), syncope is benign and self-limiting; however, it can be the initial manifestation of a life-threatening disease process (eg, cardiac syncope).</p><p>This patient&#39;s syncope is most likely due to a <strong>cardiac arrhythmia</strong>.&nbsp;

However, it is usually seen in patients with neurodegenerative disease (eg, Parkinson disease), and syncope typically occurs on standing due to an inadequate compensatory sympathetic response (eg, vasoconstriction).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Orthostatic (postural) hypotension refers to a drop in systolic blood pressure &gt;20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;10 mm Hg within 2-5 minutes of standing from a supine position.&nbsp; It is a common cause of syncope but is unlikely in this patient who was sitting in an armchair when the syncopal episode occurred.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Seizures can cause loss of consciousness and clonic jerks; however, features more suggestive of seizure include the presence of a trigger (eg, lack of sleep, emotional stress, flashing lights), a prodromal aura, tongue lacerations, and a postictal period.&nbsp; The muscle jerks experienced by this patient can occur in all types of syncope because sudden cerebral hypoperfusion often causes brief myoclonus.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of syncope; however, it is typically triggered by prolonged standing or emotional or painful stimuli.&nbsp; In addition, patients frequently experience a prodrome with nausea, pallor, dizziness, and diaphoresis prior to the syncopal episode.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with an arrhythmic cause of syncope usually have underlying structural heart disease and may not have any prodromal symptoms prior to the syncopal episode.</p>",

Inferior wall MI, usually resulting from occlusion of the right coronary artery, commonly involves the right ventricle.</p><p><strong>Right ventricular myocardial infarction</strong> (RVMI) behaves differently than left ventricular myocardial infarction (LVMI).&nbsp; Acute RV contractile dysfunction causes abruptly <strong>increased RV preload</strong> with RV dilation and jugular venous distension (JVD), and the failing RV is unable to pump adequate blood through the pulmonary circulation to the left side of the heart (decreased LV preload), resulting in reduced cardiac output and <strong>hypotension</strong>.&nbsp; The failing RV becomes reliant on hydrostatic pressure to force blood through the pulmonary circulation and is highly sensitive to a reduction in preload; <strong>nitrates</strong>, diuretics, and opioids are best <strong>avoided</strong> because they reduce RV preload and can profoundly worsen hypotension.</p><p>Hypotension in the setting of RVMI is best initially treated with <strong>intravenous normal saline</strong> to further increase RV preload and provide additional hydrostatic pressure to assist blood flow through the pulmonary circulation.&nbsp; In contrast, LV contractile dysfunction resulting from LVMI, which is often recognized by pulmonary edema (absent in this patient), worsens with increased preload, and intravenous fluids should be avoided.&nbsp; Otherwise, patients with RVMI should undergo standard <a href=\"12866\">management of an acute STEMI</a> with dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, anticoagulation, and urgent revascularization (eg, percutaneous intervention).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp;

Immediate pericardiocentesis treats cardiac tamponade, which can present similarly to RVMI (eg, hypotension, JVD, clear lungs).&nbsp; However, localized ST-segment elevation is not expected with cardiac tamponade.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Dopamine provides positive inotropy and is sometimes needed for RVMI patients with persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Transient sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block can occur during acute inferior wall MI and is managed with a temporary pacemaker.&nbsp; However, a temporary pacemaker is not indicated in this patient with normal heart rate and no evidence of atrioventricular block.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction can experience profound hypotension due to inadequate blood delivery to the left side of the heart.&nbsp; These patients should be managed initially with intravenous saline bolus to increase RV preload and assist blood delivery to the left ventricle.</p>",

Loss of intravascular volume decreases right ventricular preload, leading to a downstream <strong>decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure</strong> (PCWP), a representation of left atrial pressure (and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure).&nbsp; There is a consequent decrease in left ventricular preload, resulting in <strong>decreased cardiac output</strong> (CO) and <strong>decreased systemic blood pressure</strong> (BP).&nbsp; This in turn stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to <strong>increased heart rate</strong> and peripheral vasoconstriction (<strong>increased systemic vascular resistance</strong> [SVR]) in an attempt to maintain BP.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Low CO and BP in combination with elevated PCWP and SVR are consistent with <a href=\"17984\">cardiogenic shock</a>.&nbsp; Left ventricular dysfunction leads to decreased ejection fraction, hypotension, and elevated PCWP.&nbsp; Heart rate and SVR are increased in an effort to compensate for decreased CO.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Low SVR is suggestive of vasodilatory or distributive shock (eg, shock due to <a href=\"17981\">sepsis</a>, anaphylaxis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome).&nbsp; In the hyperdynamic phase of distributive shock, low SVR leads to low BP and a compensatory rise in heart rate and CO.&nbsp; PCWP is usually low.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Elevated BP, CO, and SVR with normal PCWP may be seen in a hyperadrenergic state due to catecholamine surge, or may be seen in preeclampsia.&nbsp; Absence of hyperreflexia in this patient makes preeclampsia less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Elevated SVR in combination with normal BP, CO, and PCWP is consistent with pre-shock or compensated shock, as may be seen in patients with mild hypovolemia.&nbsp; An initial small decrease in CO and BP causes an increase in SVR, which in combination with an increase in heart rate allows for maintenance of relatively normal CO, BP, and tissue perfusion.&nbsp; However, as the underlying condition worsens, the increase in heart rate cannot sustain adequate CO and shock ensues.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hypovolemic shock is characterized by low cardiac output and a compensatory elevation in systemic vascular resistance.&nbsp;

it competes with normal conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node.&nbsp; This mixed&nbsp;ventricular depolarization manifests on ECG as a shortened PR interval, slurred upstroke (ie, delta wave), and widened QRS complex, the <a href=\"3088\">classic WPW pattern</a>.&nbsp; WPW syndrome is defined by the&nbsp;development of paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with WPW pattern.</p><p>The most common arrhythmia seen with WPW syndrome is <a href=\"58645\">atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia</a>.&nbsp; However, <a href=\"58646\">preexcited atrial fibrillation</a> (AF) can also occur.&nbsp; Its characteristic ECG pattern is an irregularly irregular rhythm with wide QRS complexes of variable morphology (reflecting variable ventricular depolarization from either the accessory pathway or AV node).&nbsp; Preexcited AF can lead to extremely fast ventricular rates that can deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation.&nbsp; The&nbsp;rapid&nbsp;rates develop due to differences in <a href=\"111\">conduction characteristics</a>&nbsp;between the AV node and the accessory pathway.&nbsp; In the AV node, the slow calcium current prevents rapid conduction to the ventricles; in contrast, the accessory pathway is similar to atrial and ventricular myocardium (ie, phase 0 controlled by sodium channels), allowing rapid atrioventricular conduction.</p><p>Acute treatment of preexcited AF is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Hemodynamically <strong>unstable</strong> patients require immediate <strong>synchronized electrical cardioversion</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Hemodynamically <strong>stable</strong> patients (as in this patient) can receive medical therapy to slow conduction through the accessory pathway and reduce the ventricular rate or possibly convert to sinus rhythm.&nbsp; <strong>Procainamide</strong>, a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent that inhibits cardiac sodium channels, is usually the drug of choice because it slows conduction through the accessory pathway without affecting conduction through the AV node.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choices A, B, and E)</strong>&nbsp; Medications that slow conduction through the AV node, including adenosine, digoxin, verapamil, and beta blockers, should be avoided in preexcited AF because they encourage further conduction through the accessory pathway.&nbsp; Therefore, they risk&nbsp;increasing ventricular contraction rate even higher and exacerbating the risk of ventricular fibrillation.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Lidocaine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic drug that inhibits cardiac sodium channels, but it is not effective for supraventricular arrhythmias, including preexcited AF.&nbsp; It is sometimes used for ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are at risk of developing preexcited atrial fibrillation.&nbsp; Hemodynamically stable patients should be treated with procainamide to slow conduction through the accessory pathway.&nbsp; Atrioventricular node blocking agents can worsen the arrhythmia and should be avoided.</p>",

<strong>Flecainide</strong> and propafenone are <strong>class IC</strong> antiarrhythmic drugs that are occasionally used for <strong>rhythm control</strong> of <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong> (for maintenance of sinus rhythm) in patients with structurally normal hearts.&nbsp; These drugs have the slowest rate of drug binding and dissociation from the sodium channel receptor.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, flecainide does not cause any significant prolongation of the QRS duration or QT interval; however, in patients with <strong>rapid heart rates</strong>, the drug has less time to dissociate from sodium channels, leading to a higher number of blocked channels, which results in a progressive decrease in impulse conduction and <strong>widening of the QRS complex</strong>.&nbsp; This phenomenon is termed <strong>use dependence</strong> and is seen most frequently with class IC antiarrhythmic agents (less commonly with class IA drugs and rarely with class IB drugs).&nbsp; It is the primary mechanism behind their efficacy against supraventricular arrhythmias.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine) do not have a significant effect on the cardiac conduction system.&nbsp; Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) have antiarrhythmic properties via blockade of L-type calcium channels in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodes.&nbsp; These drugs also exhibit use dependence, but they cause prolongation of the PR interval with no effect on QRS complex duration.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Digoxin is not typically used as an antiarrhythmic agent and, in fact, has proarrhythmic properties in many settings.&nbsp; Due to its ability to increase vagal tone at the AV node, digoxin is sometimes used as a rate control agent for atrial fibrillation.&nbsp; Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) inhibit sympathetic activity to the heart, allowing for both antiarrhythmic and rate control properties.&nbsp; Due to their slowing of conduction through the AV node, they are commonly used for rate control of atrial fibrillation.&nbsp; Slowing of conduction through the AV node prolongs the PR interval but has no effect on QRS complex duration.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Use dependence refers to enhanced pharmacologic effects of a drug during rapid heart rates and is seen with class IC (eg, flecainide), and, to a lesser extent, class IA antiarrhythmic agents.&nbsp; These agents cause a progressive increase in sodium channel inhibition (ie, progressive decrease in impulse conduction) with faster heart rates, leading to an increase in QRS complex duration.</p>",
