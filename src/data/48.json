Intoxication with calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or cholinergic agents could cause similar symptoms, but wheezing is more specific for beta blocker toxicity.</p><p>The cardiac effects of beta blockers are mediated by the inhibition of beta-1 receptor activity, resulting in <strong>reduced intracellular cyclic AMP</strong> (cAMP).&nbsp; Reduced cAMP levels <strong>decrease contractility</strong> in contractile cardiomyocytes and slow conduction in pacemaker cells, resulting in <strong>sinoatrial and atrioventricular node dysfunction</strong>.&nbsp; The typical clinical presentation is <strong>bradyarrhythmia</strong> (eg, sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, atrioventricular block) and <strong>low cardiac output</strong> with <strong>hypotension</strong> and signs of poor organ and tissue perfusion (ie, cardiogenic shock).</p><p>Hypotension should be treated with intravenous fluids, and symptomatic bradycardia causing hemodynamic instability should be treated with atropine.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>glucagon</strong> is useful in counteracting beta blocker toxicity.&nbsp; It acts by <strong>directly increasing cAMP</strong> via activation of glucagon receptors, bypassing the blocked adrenergic receptors to increase heart rate and contractility (and improve bronchospasm and glucose metabolism when needed).</p><p>Other treatments include intravenous calcium gluconate, high-dose insulin with glucose (increases contractility), and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy (binds lipid soluble medication in the bloodstream).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Methylxanthines (eg, aminophylline, theophylline) inhibit phosphodiesterase, which increases <a href=\"65845\">intracellular cAMP levels</a>.&nbsp; This could be beneficial in beta blocker toxicity, but these drugs have a narrow therapeutic window and are not typically used in beta blocker toxicity.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) is used for severe digoxin toxicity.&nbsp; <a href=\"2155\">Digoxin toxicity</a> can present similarly to beta blocker toxicity, but wheezing is not expected and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting) and vision disturbances are common.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Although dobutamine is an inotropic catecholamine with beta-agonist effects, it is avoided in beta blocker overdose because the beta-2 receptor stimulation causes vasodilation with resultant worsening hypotension.&nbsp; Vasoconstricting sympathomimetics (eg, epinephrine) are often used for beta blocker overdose with refractory hypotension.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Temporary pacing is indicated in patients with profound bradycardia.&nbsp; However, pacing is often ineffective in beta blocker overdose because of failed capture due to underlying cellular toxicity.&nbsp; Treatments that target the cellular toxicity of beta blocker overdose (eg, glucagon) should be administered first.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cardiac beta blocker toxicity involves reduced cyclic AMP (cAMP) activity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and contractile cardiomyocytes, resulting in bradyarrhythmia and hypotension.&nbsp; Glucagon counteracts the underlying cellular toxicity by bypassing blocked adrenergic receptors to increase cAMP activity.</p>",

This potentially fatal inflammation of the myocardium is most commonly caused by <strong>viral infection</strong> (eg, coxsackievirus B, adenovirus).&nbsp; Myocyte necrosis occurs via direct viral injury and/or immune-mediated inflammation and can result in impaired systolic and diastolic function.</p><p>A viral <strong>prodrome</strong> often precedes the illness, as seen in this child with fever, rhinorrhea, congestion, and cervical lymphadenopathy.&nbsp; Patients then typically develop <strong>fatigue, tachycardia</strong>, and <strong>respiratory distress</strong> (eg, retractions, nasal flaring, tachypnea, crackles) with hypoxemia from acute left-sided heart failure and pulmonary edema.&nbsp; Because symptoms overlap with common viral illnesses, the diagnosis is challenging and may be delayed.&nbsp; However, progressive symptoms leading to dilated cardiomyopathy with <a href=\"26221\">secondary mitral regurgitation</a> can cause an <strong>S3 gallop</strong> and <strong>holosystolic murmur</strong>, as seen here.&nbsp; Reduced cardiac output can lead to hypotension, decreased peripheral pulses, and oliguria; hepatomegaly can also occur due to passive congestion from right-sided heart failure.</p><p>Initial workup includes cardiac enzymes, ECG, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram.&nbsp; <a href=\"799\">Chest x-ray</a> reveals <strong>cardiomegaly</strong> (cardiothoracic ratio &gt;50%) and bilateral hazy opacities (pulmonary edema).&nbsp; Echocardiogram often shows diffuse hypokinesis with decreased ejection fraction.&nbsp; Endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac MRI is needed to confirm the diagnosis, but treatment (eg, diuretics) is often initiated based on clinical suspicion.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) can cause fever and myocarditis, but other <a href=\"1529\">Jones criteria</a> (eg, arthritis, Sydenham chorea, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum) would be present.&nbsp; In addition, ARF occurs weeks after untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis whereas this patient&#39;s rhinorrhea and congestion are suggestive of a concurrent viral illness.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchiolitis can present with fever, congestion, and respiratory distress but would not explain this patient&#39;s gallop rhythm or holosystolic murmur.&nbsp; Wheezing is also a classic finding in bronchiolitis and not present in this patient.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Glomerulonephritis (eg, IgA nephropathy) can develop during an upper respiratory infection, but the typical presentation is intermittent hematuria.&nbsp; Acute kidney injury with oliguria is an uncommon complication of IgA nephropathy.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Myocarditis can occur in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease.&nbsp; However, the diagnosis of <a href=\"800\">Kawasaki disease</a> requires &#8805;5 days of fever and &#8805;4 clinical criteria (rash, lymphadenopathy &gt;1.5 cm, conjunctivitis, mucosal changes, extremity changes).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Myocarditis in children is most commonly caused by viral infection and typically presents following a prodromal illness with signs of heart failure (eg, respiratory distress, murmur, gallop, cardiomegaly).</p>",

Electrical alternans is a specific but poorly sensitive (often not present) finding for <strong>pericardial effusion</strong> with <strong>cardiac tamponade</strong>; it results from the heart changing position within the fluid-filled pericardial sac with each heartbeat.&nbsp; Low-voltage QRS complexes (eg, &lt;10 mm in precordial leads), as seen in this patient, are a moderately sensitive and moderately specific finding for cardiac tamponade that results from attenuation of cardiac electrical signals by fluid within the pericardial sac.</p><p><strong>Viral infection</strong> is a common cause of <strong>acute pericarditis</strong>, which can be complicated by pericardial effusion.&nbsp; This patient has likely experienced slow accumulation of fluid within the pericardial sac, leading to progressive symptoms of weakness, dyspnea, and chest discomfort.&nbsp; Eventually, the fluid compresses the relatively low-pressure right-sided heart chambers and restricts diastolic filling, leading to <strong>subacute tamponade</strong>.&nbsp; With the right-sided heart chambers unable to fill, less blood is delivered to the left side of the heart and cardiac output drops, leading to hypotension and associated symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, <strong>syncope</strong>).&nbsp;

Acute tamponade is a potential complication of cardiac procedures (eg, ablation), which may cause bleeding into the pericardial space.</p><p>As blood or fluid fills the low-compliance pericardial sac, pericardial pressure increases and compresses the cardiac chambers; the relatively low-pressure right-sided chambers are primarily affected, with <strong>restricted diastolic filling</strong> of the <strong>right atrium and right ventricle</strong>.&nbsp; As these chambers are unable to fill, less blood is pumped to the left side of the heart and <strong>cardiac index</strong> (CI) (a measure of cardiac output per body surface area) <strong>decreases</strong>, resulting in hypotension and <strong>obstructive shock</strong>.&nbsp;

Given his cardiac catheterization showing no acute coronary occlusion and symptom onset while grilling over charcoal, he likely has acute <strong>carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning</strong> induced&ndash;myocardial infarction (MI).</p><p>CO binds to hemoglobin with great affinity, displacing oxygen (O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) to create carboxyhemoglobin.&nbsp; This <strong>reduces O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>-carrying capacity</strong>, decreases O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> unloading in tissues (hemoglobin dissociation curve left shift), and impairs O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> utilization (disrupted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation).&nbsp; Accordingly, while mild CO poisoning presents nonspecifically (eg, headache [most common], nausea, dizziness), severe CO poisoning can cause:</p><ul><li><p>Cerebral hypoxia:&nbsp; <strong>Drowsiness</strong>, confusion, seizures, syncope, coma</p></li><li><p>Lactic acidosis:&nbsp; <strong>Elevated lactate</strong> (impaired oxygen utilization)</p></li><li><p>Myocardial injury:&nbsp; Ventricular arrhythmias, <strong>myocardial ischemia</strong> (ECG changes, hypertroponinemia even without obstructive coronary lesions), pulmonary edema (cardiac dysfunction or CO-induced alveolar damage).</p></li></ul><p>Acute MI is reported in 1/3 of patients with CO poisoning and is associated with increased mortality.</p><p>Diagnosis of CO poisoning is best confirmed via <strong>co-oximetry</strong> of <strong>arterial blood gas</strong> showing <strong>elevated carboxyhemoglobin</strong> levels (&gt;3% for nonsmokers, &gt;10% for smokers) in a symptomatic patient.&nbsp; Treatment with 100% O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> by nonrebreather facemask increases blood O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> level and enhances CO removal via the lungs.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in managing cocaine toxicity, which can cause MI.&nbsp; However, dilated pupils and hyperstimulation (not drowsiness) would be expected.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and F)</strong>&nbsp; CT scan of the chest and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are indicated if pulmonary (eg, interstitial lung disease) or cardiac (eg, valve abnormalities) processes are suspected.&nbsp; TEE is also used in patients with hemodynamic instability and concern for aortic dissection, which can cause chest pain and ECG changes but usually causes mediastinal widening on x-ray.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s presentation can be explained by CO poisoning; these studies risk further delaying management of CO poisoning without providing useful information.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain, dyspnea, ECG changes, hypertroponinemia, and rarely bilateral infiltrates.&nbsp; However, lactate elevation would be uncommon in the absence of a massive embolism causing obstructive shock and hypoperfusion.&nbsp; His oxygen saturation level (&gt;90%) should not make him drowsy either.&nbsp; An&nbsp;ABG to&nbsp;check for carboxyhemoglobin level is much&nbsp;easier (and less contrast exposure)&nbsp;to obtain than CT angiogram.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Metformin-induced lactic acidosis is unlikely to occur acutely and is not classically associated with MI.&nbsp; Although stopping metformin is necessary in this hospitalized patient with lactic acidosis, evaluation for CO poisoning is indicated.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Carbon monoxide poisoning disrupts oxygen delivery and usage, which can cause clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia.&nbsp; Elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; Severe cases require hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</p>",

Cardiac tamponade is classified as acute or subacute based on the rate and volume of pericardial fluid accumulation.</p><p>Subacute tamponade typically develops from chronic processes that cause the slow accumulation of pericardial fluid (eg, malignancy, renal failure), giving the pericardium time to progressively stretch.&nbsp; The pericardium may accommodate 1-2 L of fluid before intrapericardial pressure rises and compromises cardiac function.&nbsp; This large quantity of pericardial fluid causes the classic <a href=\"43819\">globular cardiac silhouette</a> on x-ray.</p><p>In contrast, acute tamponade occurs due to <strong>rapid fluid accumulation</strong> (eg, accumulation of blood due to blunt cardiac injury in this patient).&nbsp; Because the stiff pericardium does not have time to adapt, a <strong>small amount of pericardial fluid</strong> (eg, 100-200 mL) can dramatically increase intrapericardial pressure without causing cardiomegaly on x-ray (typically seen with &gt;200 mL).&nbsp; Therefore, acute tamponade is associated with <strong>normal cardiac contours</strong>, as in this patient.</p><p>On physical examination, patients may have hypotension with elevated jugular venous pressure (obstructive shock due to the pericardial fluid preventing adequate cardiac contraction) as well as muffled heart sounds (Beck triad, only seen in a minority of patients).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s small, left-sided pleural effusion may be due to blood leaking from the pericardium (eg, through a small tear) or a concomitant injury (eg, lacerated lung parenchyma).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Aortic rupture is often immediately fatal.&nbsp; In rare instances, aortic rupture with bleeding into the left pleural space that has been contained (eg, by a hematoma) can present with left-sided pleural effusion and hypotension.&nbsp; However, it would cause hypovolemic (rather than obstructive) hypotension with flat (rather than distended) neck veins.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Traumatic bronchial rupture (air leaking from the tracheobronchial tree into the pleural space) can cause hypotension and jugular venous distension.&nbsp; However, this typically occurs with massive extrapulmonary air leakage, which would be associated with tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema (not seen on this patient&#39;s x-ray).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Esophageal rupture can allow efflux of gastrointestinal contents into the pleural space (causing pleural effusion) and mediastinum (causing mediastinitis, a systemic inflammatory response, and vasodilatory hypotension).&nbsp;

Cardiac bleeding can lead to rapid accumulation of <strong>blood in the pericardial space</strong>, which increases pericardial pressure, compresses the cardiac chambers, and <strong>restricts diastolic filling</strong>.&nbsp; The relatively low-pressure right-sided chambers are affected first; as these chambers become unable to fill, less blood is pumped through the lungs to the left side of the heart, resulting in reduced cardiac output, hypotension, and <a href=\"38617\">obstructive shock</a>.&nbsp;

Bypass graft failure can cause myocardial ischemia or infarction and lead to left ventricular failure.&nbsp; Chordae tendineae rupture can cause acute mitral regurgitation and left ventricular failure.&nbsp; These conditions are expected to cause pressure findings consistent with <a href=\"17984\">cardiogenic shock</a>, which are similar to those seen in cardiac tamponade, but equalization of diastolic pressures is not expected.&nbsp; In cardiogenic shock, PCWP is expected to be higher than right-sided diastolic pressures, and pulmonary edema is typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; A large pulmonary embolism can cause <a href=\"28348\">obstructive shock</a>, but low PCWP is expected, as is typical with pre-pulmonary obstruction (cardiac tamponade is an exception in which external compression increases PCWP despite reduced blood flow through the lungs to the left atrium).&nbsp;

            "explanationText": "<p><strong>Peripheral edema</strong> is a common side effect of <strong>calcium channel blocker</strong> (CCB) therapy, with a reported incidence of approximately 25% after 6 months of therapy.&nbsp; The edema is likely related to <strong>preferential dilation of precapillary vessels</strong> (arteriolar dilation), which leads to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation into the interstitium.&nbsp; Dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs such as amlodipine and nifedipine are potent arteriolar dilators and cause more peripheral edema than nondihydropyridine CCBs (eg, diltiazem, verapamil).&nbsp; Other major side effects of DHP CCBs include headache, flushing, and lightheadedness.</p><p>ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers cause post-capillary venodilation and may help normalize the increased capillary hydrostatic pressure caused by CCBs.&nbsp; In clinical studies, the <strong>combination of a CCB and ACE inhibitor</strong> was associated with a significantly <strong>lower risk of CCB-associated peripheral edema</strong> compared with CCB monotherapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; The most common side effects of hydrochlorothiazide are electrolyte imbalances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia), renal failure, hyperuricemia (which may precipitate acute gout), and increased glucose and cholesterol levels.&nbsp; Hydrochlorothiazide is expected to reduce peripheral edema via increased renal sodium excretion.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and E)</strong>&nbsp; ACE inhibitors (eg, ramipril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (eg, losartan) can cause a slight reduction in glomerular filtration rate following initiation (due to inhibition of glomerular efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction), but this is rarely enough to cause peripheral edema.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Side effects of beta blockers include bradyarrhythmias, generalized fatigue, sexual dysfunction, increased airway resistance in patients with obstructive lung disease, and worsening of decompensated heart failure.&nbsp; In the absence of decompensated heart failure, beta blockers do not cause or contribute to peripheral edema.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Peripheral edema is a common side effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine), likely resulting from preferential arteriolar vasodilation and increased peripheral capillary hydrostatic pressure.&nbsp; The addition of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker may reduce calcium channel blocker-associated peripheral edema.</p>",

Venous stasis is common in patients who are older, obese, or have a history of venous thrombosis.&nbsp; Increased intraluminal pressure or loss of vessel wall tensile strength can lead to venous dilation and failure of the venous valves.&nbsp; The resulting backflow of blood exacerbates the venous hypertension, leading to further valvular incompetence and venous congestion.</p><p>Elevated venous pressure and increased vascular permeability lead to extravasation of fluid, plasma proteins, and red blood cells.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include scaling, weeping, superficial erosions, and pitting edema.&nbsp; Itching and achy pain are common but usually mild.&nbsp; Acute inflammation can manifest as <a href=\"21980\">erythema</a> and warmth resembling cellulitis (although unlike cellulitis, it is typically bilateral and symmetric).&nbsp; Chronic findings include <strong>red/brown discoloration</strong> (due to deposition of hemosiderin), <strong>woody induration</strong>, and fibrosis.&nbsp; Microvascular disease, platelet aggregation, and increased expression of proteolytic enzymes can cause chronic irregular <a href=\"21981\">ulcers</a>, most commonly at the medial malleolus.</p><p>The diagnosis of stasis dermatitis is usually obvious based on <strong>clinical findings</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Duplex ultrasonography</strong> is not routinely performed but can confirm venous hypertension and reflux and rule out venous thrombosis in patients with acute unilateral symptoms.&nbsp; Management includes <strong>compression stockings</strong>, leg elevation, exercise, and avoidance of prolonged standing.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Ankle brachial index is used to evaluate lower extremity arterial insufficiency; common indications include intermittent claudication, dermal atrophy, and absent distal pulses.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s skin discoloration and palpable pulses are more consistent with venous insufficiency.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a skin condition frequently seen in patients with diabetes.&nbsp; Because the skin lesions may precede the onset of diabetes, patients should be screened with a hemoglobin A1c or fasting blood glucose.&nbsp; Although NLD typically occurs in the pretibial areas, it presents as <a href=\"21982\">multifocal lesions</a> with a brownish hue, dilated blood vessels, and central epidermal atrophy.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Inguinal lymph node biopsy is indicated for lower extremity malignancy, especially melanoma.&nbsp; Melanoma typically presents as a focal pigmented lesion with an asymmetric, irregular border.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s skin changes involve most of the lower leg, which is more consistent with stasis dermatitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Thyroid dermopathy is typically seen in patients with Graves disease and presents as induration and thickening of the skin over the shins (pretibial myxedema).&nbsp; It is almost always associated with other signs of Graves disease (eg, goiter, ophthalmopathy).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Allergen patch testing can be considered for chronic lower extremity dermatitis that worsens despite appropriate treatment or involves specific areas of allergen exposure (eg, under footwear).&nbsp; Allergic contact dermatitis typically involves limited, well-demarcated areas and is characterized by significant itching and lichenification.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Skin biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis of stasis dermatitis and should be avoided because the involved skin heals poorly.&nbsp; Indications for biopsy include atypical symptoms, solitary or unilateral disease, and suspicion for malignancy.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Stasis dermatitis is characterized by scaling, weeping, superficial erosions, and pitting edema.&nbsp; Chronic findings include red/brown discoloration, woody induration, fibrosis, and chronic ulcers.&nbsp; The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings, although duplex ultrasonography can confirm venous hypertension and reflux.</p>",

            "explanationText": "<p>This patient was initially admitted for chest pain (possibly unstable angina given the ST depressions on ECG) and appropriately treated (eg, antiplatelet therapy, beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, anticoagulation therapy).&nbsp; His subsequent acute-onset dyspnea with wheezing and prolonged expiration on the second day of hospitalization indicates <strong>bronchoconstriction</strong>.&nbsp; Given his history of allergic rhinitis and eczema and his prior intermittent episodes of dyspnea and coughing, the patient likely has undiagnosed <strong>asthma</strong>&nbsp;that is now exacerbated by aspirin or possibly beta blocker therapy.</p><p><strong>Aspirin</strong> is a common trigger for bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma, especially those with concurrent <strong>chronic rhinitis</strong> and <strong>nasal polyps</strong>.&nbsp; Nonselective <strong>beta blockers</strong> (eg, propranolol, nadolol, sotalol, timolol) act on &#946;1 and &#946;2 receptors and often trigger <strong>bronchoconstriction</strong> in patients with underlying asthma.&nbsp; Cardioselective beta blockers (eg, metoprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol) act predominantly on &#946;1 receptors and are generally considered safe in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma.&nbsp; However, all beta blockers can trigger bronchoconstriction, especially when administered in large doses.</p><p>This medication-triggered&nbsp;bronchoconstriction can lead to a cough.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>ACE inhibitors</strong> (eg, lisinopril) can cause <strong>dry cough</strong> through increased levels of circulating bradykinin and resultant bronchial irritation.&nbsp; Onset of the cough can occur soon after ACE inhibitor initiation (as is likely the case in this patient) or can be delayed (eg, months); it is not affected by underlying asthma.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) and characterized by persistent cough, sometimes with sputum production.&nbsp; The timing of symptom onset (1-2 days after new medications) and lack of other symptoms suggestive of URI (eg, rhinorrhea) make acute bronchitis less likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pericarditis is characterized by sharp, pleuritic chest pain that is often relieved with leaning forward.&nbsp; A pericardial friction rub may be present on cardiac auscultation.&nbsp; Dyspnea is less common, and bronchoconstriction is not typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Physical examination in patients with pleural effusion shows dullness to percussion of the chest wall, decreased breath sounds, and decreased movement of the ipsilateral chest wall.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with pulmonary embolism can have chest pain, dyspnea, and/or tachypnea.&nbsp; Wheezing and prolonged expiration are possible but not typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Recurrent myocardial ischemia can cause dyspnea and wheezing if it leads to impaired left ventricular function with resulting pulmonary edema.&nbsp; Such patients would have bibasilar rales and may have jugular venous distension (JVD).</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction usually present with hypotension, JVD, and clear lung fields, usually in the setting of inferior wall myocardial infarction.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Aspirin and beta blockers are common medications that can trigger bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma.&nbsp; Short-term use of cardioselective beta blockers is usually safe in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, but all beta blockers should be used with caution.</p>",
