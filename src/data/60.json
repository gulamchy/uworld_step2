This presentation suggests&nbsp;<strong>osteomalacia</strong>, characterized by reduced mineralization of osteoid at bone-forming sites.&nbsp; Osteomalacia is common in patients with malabsorptive disorders (eg, Crohn disease with bowel resection) due to <strong>chronic deficiency of vitamin D</strong>.</p><p>Although patients can be asymptomatic, many develop <strong>generalized&nbsp;</strong><strong>bone pain</strong>&nbsp;(including at the sites of pseudofractures) and <strong>muscle weakness</strong>.&nbsp; Alkaline phosphatase levels are almost always elevated, reflecting increased bone remodeling.&nbsp; Vitamin D deficiency leads to decreased intestinal calcium (leading to hypocalcemia) and phosphorus absorption (leading to hypophosphatemia).&nbsp; Hypocalcemia and low vitamin D levels trigger increased <strong>parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong>&nbsp;secretion (ie, secondary hyperparathyroidism), which <a href=\"20543\">increases bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption</a>.&nbsp; PTH also increases urinary phosphate excretion, which further worsens hypophosphatemia.&nbsp; Therefore, the net effect is <strong>increased PTH</strong>, <strong>very low serum phosphorus</strong>, and <strong>mildly low or low-normal serum calcium</strong>.</p><p>Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are low (decreased total body stores), levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are variable because it is produced in the kidneys in response to PTH.&nbsp; &nbsp;X-ray findings seen with osteomalacia&nbsp;include cortical thinning, concave vertebral bodies (codfish vertebrae), and <strong>pseudofractures</strong> (<a href=\"26250\">Looser zones</a>).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Increased calcium, low phosphate, and increased PTH levels are seen in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.&nbsp; Although hyperparathyroidism can cause osteopenia, most patients are asymptomatic or have minor, nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, constipation).&nbsp; Pseudofractures, diffuse bony tenderness, and history of intestinal resection more strongly suggest osteomalacia.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Low calcium, increased phosphate, and low PTH levels are seen in patients with hypoparathyroidism.&nbsp; Symptoms typically relate to hypocalcemia (eg, carpal spasm, perioral paresthesia), and osteopenia would be unexpected.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Normal levels of calcium, vitamin D, and PTH would be seen in osteoporosis, which would cause decreased bone density but would not cause generalized bone pain/tenderness, muscle weakness, or pseudofractures.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Osteolytic bone metastases release calcium and phosphorus from bone, suppressing PTH secretion.&nbsp; A compensatory increase in fibroblast growth factor 23 may subsequently normalize serum phosphorus.&nbsp; X-rays would show irregular lytic lesions rather than symmetric pseudofractures.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Intestinal malabsorption with chronic vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, which is characterized by reduced mineralization of osteoid.&nbsp; Symptoms include bone pain and muscle weakness.&nbsp; Laboratory findings include hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, increased parathyroid hormone, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.&nbsp; X-ray findings include cortical thinning, concave vertebral bodies, and pseudofractures.</p>",
